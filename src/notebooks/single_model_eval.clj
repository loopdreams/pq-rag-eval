;; ## Goal
;; In the previous section we looked at a broad range of models to try to get a
;; sense of the best performing ones in this context.
;;
;; However, we might have been "putting the cart before the horse" a little in
;; that case. It might be better to get the best retrieval/generation 'pipeline'
;; in place first, and then we could swap in different models to test their
;; effectivness.
;;
;; When it comes to RAG applications, there are many different ways you can vary
;; a configuration, and it's hard to know where to start. In this section we'll
;; see if we can narrow our focus in on evaluating:
;;
;;  a. our prompt
;;
;;  b. our retrieval strategy
;;

;; ## LLM-Generated Evaluation Dataset
;;
;; Before we move on to answering our question, it might be better to have a
;; larger evaluation dataset. In the last section, we used a 10-question
;; evaluation dataset that I filled in manually. Ideally, we would have more
;; questions to get a better sense of how a model performs.  Luckily, we can
;; also use an LLM to help us generate some evaluation questions for testing.
;;
;; To generate a questions/answer pair, we will pass the model some context, In
;; this case, we will use full answers from the original dataset, and ask it to
;; generate a single question for each answer it is passed.
;;
;; As a side note, from this exercise I learned that some more cleaning would be
;; needed on the original data, as there are quite a few answers that don't
;; contain useful information, for example, when they simply indicate that a
;; question has been directed elsewhere.

;; As you can see, the LLM-generated questions/answers are quite specific, and
;; look like a good way to test how well our RAG can find information based on a
;; user's question.
;;
;; Now that we have an evaluation dataset, we can try to build a pipeline to
;; evaluate the performance of a model with different settings applied.

;; ## Evaluation Pipeline
;;
;; Here, I'll chain together some of the functions from previous notebooks to build a
;; single 'pipeline' for evaluating a model.
;;
;; The aim will be to test 4 different generation approaches:

;; 1. Prompt A with chunked answers database (**A1**)
;;
;; 2. Prompt A with questions database (**A2**)
;;
;; 3. Prompt B with chunked answers database (**B1**)
;;
;; 4. Prompt B with questions database (**B2**)
;;
;; In other words we are trying to vary the prompts, and the retrieval
;; strategy.
;;
;; As a reminder, in earlier sections we explored different retrieval
;; approaches. One involved splitting up the 'answer' column in the original
;; dataset into 'chunks', and then storing these in the database. We saw that
;; the potential optimum 'chunk size' was around 3 sentences per chunk.
;;
;; The alternative, initial approach was to store questions from the original
;; dataset in a vector database, retrieve similar questions to the user's
;; question, and then use these to 'look up' their answers in the original
;; dataset. The logic here was that if similar questions have been asked
;; previously, then these answers could be re-used as context for the LLM.
;;
;; The first approach, above, is the standard way of creating a vector database
;; for a RAG, but we can test below to see if it really is the best approach.

;; Our second variable to explore is the prompt.

;; Our initial prompt was as follows:
;;
;;> I want you to act as a responsible and trustworthy senior government
;;> official. Please provide an answer to a citizen's question, using only the
;;> context provided. Answer as if you are talking directly to the citizen and be
;;> neutral and formal as possible. If you can't find a specific detail from the
;;> question, please acknowledge this and provide any other helpful information
;;> that may be related to the question.  If you can't find sufficient
;;> information in the context to answer the question at all, then reply with \"I
;;> am unable to answer this question with the information I have available.\"

;; For the second prompt, we'll actually try something relatively similar. The
;; point here will be to see if the results vary dramatically with only small
;; changes to the prompt. I'll mainly drop the word 'please' and also refer to
;; the question-asker as a 'user' as opposed to a 'citizen'.

;; In relation to our two scenarios:
;;
;; - The slight changes to the prompt resulted in very slight differences in the
;;   results, which is good to see (there is some predictability there). We can't
;;   see exactly *why* the second prompt was slightly better than the first, but
;;   it a useful result nonetheless. Overall the second prompt (removing the
;;   word 'please' and changing a few of the sentences, but otherwise leaving
;;   the instructions mostly the same) with the document-retrieval method worked
;;   the best, and achieved 100% faithfulness.
;;
;; - A much more significant difference emerges in relation to the best
;;   retrieval strategy. Retrieving the information from the chunked answers
;;   directly seems to do much better than my initial instinct of searching
;;   through similar questions first.
;;
;; Even though we tested retrieval earlier, viewing the potential impact that
;; different retrieval strategies can have on the generated response is very

;; returning the *wrong* information. Let's have a look at that context to see.

;; This seems to be the context that caused the confusion. After a quick Google
;; search, it seems that DETE is responsible for administering the scheme to
;; **small businesses**, but the correct answer is indeed "The Irish Red Cross"
;; as was indicated in the evaluation dataset.
;;
;; This is yet another example of why lots of testing and fine tuning is needed
;; to perfect this kind of application.

;; Let's finally see how many questions in the dataset were 'unanswerable', due
;; to the retrieval method not providing context. It seems there are two ways to
;; filter for this, (a) the model provided the default answer, and (b) the
;; answer received a low correctness score.

;; The question retrieval method did quite badly, failing on around 20-28% of
;; the questions. The chunked-docs retrieval method failed on 3 questions (6%).


;; ## Summary
;;
;; The main conclusion from this section is the importance of the **document
;; retrieval** method used to provide context for the RAG.
;;
;; It seems like this can be improved in a few ways:
;;
;; - More data cleaning and preparation on the data before storing it in a
;;   vector database. For example, doing more work to remove potentially
;;   duplicate/redundant  information.
;;
;; - Experiment and test different strategies for breaking up the information
;;   before storing it.
;;
;; The best approach here would also depend heavily on the end-use case. For
;; example, if you only wanted to retrieve specific pieces of information (as in
;; the evaluation dataset used in this section), then smaller, more precise
;; chunks of information seem to work better. However, if you wanted to answer
;; very broad questions about policy or strategy, then maybe you would want
;; larger chunks of information stored.
;;
;; From what I could see, the model is very capable of finding the relevant
;; information from the context, once the context is properly provided.
;;
;; Overall, some other key takeaways were:
;;
;; - Developing a RAG system means tinkering with multiple different
;;   parts/modules within a pipeline. Clojure's emphasis on immutable,
;;   composable functions seems to make this kind of work very easy and
;;   intuitive.
;;
;; - However, it seems like there is potentially a gap in the clojure ecosystem
;;   in terms of Natural Language Processing techniques/libraries. Or, at least
;;   in the short time to develop this project before the conference, I ended up
;;   relying on work in python for some of the token-based/semantic metrics. I
;;   also had to rely on java for the vector database (although I found this
;;   process relatively straight-forward). I would say that I spent around half
;;   the time for this project figuring out how to 'reproduce' python material
;;   in clojure, and half thinking about the actual questions related to the
;;   data. Which, in my case (a hobbyist programmer) was totally fine - I
;;   learned a lot by doing it!  However, if there was some kind of project
;;   deadline this kind of consideration might tip the balance if favour of just
;;   using python, where there already seems to be so much work put into RAG
;;   evaluation libraries.
;;
;; - I should have spent more time at the outset curating and cleaning the
;;   initial dataset. I would love, for example, to have seen how the models
;;   performed when there was information that was potentially out of date. In
;;   my case, the 'window' for data was very short (2 months), which would not
;;   make sense in an actual application of this type.
;;
;; ## Next Steps
;;
;; Finally, here are a couple of ideas that occurred to me throughout the work,
;; but which I didn't get time to explore:
;;
;; - As we saw above, the LLM-generated metrics seem to be much better at
;;   spotting errors than the other metric types. The creators of the
;;   [continuous-eval
;;   repository](https://github.com/relari-ai/continuous-eval/tree/main) have a
;;   very interesting article on [generation
;;   evaluation.](https://blog.relari.ai/a-practical-guide-to-rag-evaluation-part-2-generation-c79b1bde0f5d)
;;   In it they discuss evaluation in a more 'practical' context, where, for
;;   example, the time and cost of evaluating a pipeline using another LLM would
;;   become a significant factor. So, they construct a 'hybrid' pipline that (a)
;;   uses a combination of the deterministic/semantic metrics to do a first pass
;;   on the data, and then (b) filter out datapoints where the metric cannot
;;   decide with confidence if the answer is acceptable. For these 'low
;;   confidence' evaluations, you would then pass them to a LLM-evaluator model
;;   to clarify. In their test they only had to use the LLM reviews on 7% of
;;   answer, saving 15x on costs.
;;
;; - It would be interesting to apply similar evaluation frameworks to the
;;   original, human-generated answers in the dataset. This would be with the
;;   aim of helping policymakers identify strengths and weaknesses in how
;;   information is provided in this important public setting.
