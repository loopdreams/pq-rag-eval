I appreciate your inquiry. The Government is actively addressing the challenges facing general practice to ensure sustainable healthcare services for all citizens. Steps have been taken to enhance GP training opportunities and increase the number of practicing GPs in the country to improve access to care. Additionally, a comprehensive Strategic Review of General Practice is underway, involving input from various stakeholders to address issues related to GP capacity and develop measures for a more sustainable future for general practice. This review will also focus on attracting GPs to underserved rural and urban areas to improve access to healthcare services in those regions.
