I am advised by Revenue that its drugs interdiction strategy supports the Government’s strategic approach to the misuse of drugs under the National Drugs Strategy 2017-2025.\n\nAs the Deputy is aware, the Government’s approach to the misuse of drugs is set out in Ireland’s National Drug Strategy, ‘Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery’. This is a health-led approach to drug and alcohol use in Ireland, and it represents a whole-of-Government response to reduce demand and associated harms. The Government is also committed to limiting access to illegal drugs to the greatest extent possible.\n\n These large seizures demonstrate the close cooperation between Gardaí and partner services to interrupt the supply of illegal drugs into and throughout the country.The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy \" The implementation of the strategy is led by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy. However, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda Síochána.  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use.\n\nThe national drug strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, sets out government policy on drug and alcohol use for the period 2017 to 2025. The strategy provides an integrated health-led approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery. The vision of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery is for a healthier and safer Ireland.\n\nThis strategy represents a whole of Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. This Government is acutely aware of the sustained and significant damage that the importation and use of illicit drugs has on communities right across the country and that it funds organised crime. Every effort is made to combat not just the importation of illicit drugs but also firearms, ammunition and cash that inevitably accompany this very serious organised criminal activity.", :answer "The government is actively implementing the National Drug Strategy, 'Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery', which runs from 2017 to 2025. This strategy represents a comprehensive and integrated health-led approach to drug and alcohol use in Ireland, aiming to reduce harm for individuals, families, and communities while promoting rehabilitation and recovery.\n\nThe strategy involves a whole-of-Government response, recognizing the need to reduce both demand for and access to illegal drugs. It includes actions from various stakeholders, with significant leadership from the Department of Health, particularly by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Wellbeing, and the National Drugs Strategy.\n\nAdditionally, the government's interdiction strategy, led by Revenue, focuses on preventing, detecting, intercepting, and seizing controlled drugs intended for smuggling or illegal importation or exportation. There is also close collaboration between An Garda Síochána and partner services to disrupt the supply of illegal drugs within the country.\n\nOverall, the government remains committed to tackling the misuse of drugs and reducing the associated harms while working towards a healthier and safer Ireland."} {:question "What is the government doing to help improve GP services?", :ground-truth ["Increased annual investment of over €211 million was provided for under the 2019 GP Agreement, providing for increased GP fees, supports and new services."
