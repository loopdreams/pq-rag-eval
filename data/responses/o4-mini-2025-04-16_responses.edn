This is a health-led approach to drug and alcohol use in Ireland, and it represents a whole-of-Government response to reduce demand and associated harms. The Government is also committed to limiting access to illegal drugs to the greatest extent possible.\n\n These large seizures demonstrate the close cooperation between Gardaí and partner services to interrupt the supply of illegal drugs into and throughout the country.The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy \" The implementation of the strategy is led by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy. However, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda Síochána.  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use.\n\nThe national drug strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, sets out government policy on drug and alcohol use for the period 2017 to 2025.
