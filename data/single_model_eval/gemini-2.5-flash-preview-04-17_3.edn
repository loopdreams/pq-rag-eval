In the Regulations “medical consultant” means a registered medical practitioner who— (a) is registered on the Specialist Division of the register of medical practitioners established and maintained by the Medical Council under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 (No. 25 of 2007), and (b) by reason of his or her training, skill and experience in a medical specialty recognised by the Medical Council under section 89(1) of that Act related to a specified therapeutic indication, is consulted by other registered medical practitioners and has a continuing clinical and professional responsibility for that aspect of the patient’s care on which he or she has been consulted.

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. Louth County Council has indicated that Dunleer remains their top priority project, and a new fire station at Dunleer is provided for in the Fire services Capital Programme 2021 - 2025.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 729 and 730 together.The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.\n\nLocal authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters. In December 2020 I announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme under which a total of 35 “Class B” fire appliances were allocated across the fire authorities. It was envisaged that through an extension of that framework an additional allocation of appliances would be proposed for the period 2024-2025.\n\nLocal authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters. My Department continues to support the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) who are leading engagement with staff representatives on the implementation of recommendations contained within the Retained Review published in December 2022 and the WRC Agreement. I continue to closely monitor the engagement of the LGMA and Fire Services Management to ensure that the implementation of the WRC agreement continues to be a top priority for 2024.",

If you can't find any information in the context to answer\n       the question, then reply with \"I am unable to answer this question with\n       the information I have available.\" \n\n CONTEXT: As requested, tabular data on the monies dispersed under the Technological Sector Advancement Fund is laid out below:   As may be seen from the table, €9,500,000 has been ring-fenced for South East Technological University, of which over €6 million has already been paid out- an equivalent investment to that in Technological University Dublin, and ahead of other technological universities. The Government has delivered a university presence to the South East spanning four campus locations for the first time in the history of the State. The South East Technological University (SETU) established on 1 May 2022 is the third largest technological university and enables students in the South East to study and gain qualifications at all levels of the NFQ, up to and including doctoral degrees, in their own region.\n\nSETU is also a catalyst for regional development and socio-economic progress in the South East. The Department also remains committed to providing capital funding supports to SETU. For example, the new Engineering, Computing and General Teaching building which is planned for SETU Waterford Campus is progressing as part of bundle II of the 'Higher Education PPP Programme'. This building will add significant capacity to the campus to help address increased demand.\n\nThe Government through my Department remains fully committed to the delivery of the Engineering, Computing and General Teaching building at the South East Technological University (SETU) campus at Waterford. The project in Waterford is the largest in the Higher Education PPP Programme and will be transformative for SETU. It will consist of undergraduate and postgraduate laboratories, general and specialised teaching space, learning resource space, administration space and ancillary space. Student numbers catered for by the new building will be c.\n\nTechnological Universities are autonomous bodies established under the Technological Universities Act 2018. Technological Universities regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes. The Technological Universities Act provides that the President shall be appointed by the Technological University and that the selection criteria, including experience, training and expertise appropriate to the functions of a president under the Act, and procedures in respect of the appointment of a president shall be established by the technological university.\n\nThe first tertiary programmes commenced in September 2023, and earlier this month I announced a major expansion of joint degree courses with more than 40 options to be offered this year.   It is clear that substantial progress has been made to date and that Technological Universities are contributing substantially to a dynamic and innovative higher education system.",

While I am precluded under the above mentioned act from commenting on or intervening in any individual case, should you wish to provide further information in respect of your specific query, I will be better placed to provide a more detailed update.\n\nLocal authorities are independent statutory bodies with their own democratically elected councils, and management and governance structures.  Under Section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001, a local authority is \"independent in the performance of its functions\".  The disposal and acquisition of land are local authority functions.\n\nLocal authorities have a role in planning for tourism and recreational uses within the context of their role as planning authorities as set out in the Planning and Development Act. They also have a role in the development of tourism and recreational facilities as part of their economic development function. In this regard section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001, provides that a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.\n\nWhile I have some limited powers to examine matters in relation to functions conferred on me as Minister or in relation to the performance of functions of local authorities, it should not be necessary or appropriate for such powers to be exerted where there are sufficient powers available to the elected council and procedures in place under the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) for a matter to be fully and appropriately considered at the local level.\n\n Funding approval under the AHF is now in place to assist with the delivery of 10 affordable purchase homes at Shannon, while schemes in Ennis are currently being explored and developed.  In relation to the circumstances in which designated activity companies may be established and used by local authorities for any purpose, it is important to note that local authorities are independent statutory bodies with their own democratically elected councils, and management and governance structures. Under Section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001, a local authority is \"independent in the performance of its functions\".",

Strand 2 also saw the Creative Climate Action Programme move to its second phase of funding of €2.545 million for 39 projects approved in July 2023. These are currently being implemented with a completion target of 2025.\n\n14 projects from Phase 1 of the Creative Climate Action Programme, which saw €1 million allocated from the Climate Action Fund, are now complete. I’m aware that there have been delays in the roll-out of Strand 1/1a of the programme which focuses on building low carbon communities. Some of these delays were due to the time required to recruit the Community Climate Action Officers (CCAOs).\n\n My Department has also provided a range of other significant funding options for communities and voluntary organisations to lead on climate action including:• EU Just Transition Fund Programme• Community Climate Action Programme – Creative Climate Action Phase 2 (more details here)\n\nProjects are being implemented across a range of activities, including regional development, green energy, tourism, conservation, regeneration and retrofitting of buildings, education, food research, and business development. The following table sets out an overview of the grant funding provided to these projects.   In relation to Ireland's EU Just Transition Fund Programme, details of grant awards under individual funding calls will be made available as they are announced through the website of the Programme's Managing Authority at  Separately, the Climate Action Plan 2023 committed the Government to the establishment a Just Transition Commission to provide advice to Government on how to ensure a just transition.\n\n While my officials were working towards the end of 2023 for completion, it is important to ensure that the Strategy aligns with the latest climate data and projections and with the detailed pathways to 2030 set out in Climate Action Plan 2024, published 20 December 2023. As such, the Strategy will now be finalised in Q1 2024. The updated Strategy will be the first national long-term climate strategy to be prepared in line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Acts 2015 to 2021.",

Due to the shortage of professional drivers in Ireland and across the EU, Ministerial policy is to give priority to consideration of driving licence exchange agreements with suitable countries that are likely to be a source of drivers who would like to work professionally in Ireland.\n\nIreland may make bilateral driving licence exchange agreements with non-EU jurisdictions. Such agreements can be made only when the authorities in both jurisdictions have studied and compared the licensing regimes and each side is satisfied that they are compatible.

If you can't find any information in the context to answer\n       the question, then reply with \"I am unable to answer this question with\n       the information I have available.\" \n\n CONTEXT: Lands at the Department of Defence owned site at Columb Barracks, Mullingar was agreed by Government for transfer to the Land Development Agency (LDA) under Housing for All, with the potential to deliver approximately 100 new homes. I understand that an advisory group was set up in January 2021 to provide an opportunity for key partners to collaborate and advise the LDA in developing a vision for the Barracks site. The objective of the forum is to enable a better understanding of the complexities surrounding the site and its recent uses.\n\nthat delayed earlier forecasted dates of completion on sites included in the programme. In March 2023, in addition to the OPW Rapid build programme, Columb Barracks in Mullingar was selected by Government as 1 of 5 ‘proof of concept sites’ in order to examine the potential of ‘pod’ style accommodation. Initially, it was agreed that 50 ‘pod’ style units would be delivered, accommodating up to 200 BOTPs in total.\n\nWork is also underway at Devoy Barracks in Naas, Co Kildare, which will see 219 homes being delivered. Additionally, the transfer of ESB land in Wilton, Cork is progressing, with design work underway to allow the LDA to submit a planning application for the site within the next year. It has the potential to deliver up to 300 new homes in the area.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.Under Housing for All, the Government has targeted the delivery of 28,500 new affordable homes from 2022 to 2026, to be facilitated by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. Mayo County Council has prepared and published its own 5-year Housing Delivery Action Plan.\n\nAs the Deputy is aware, the Government has decided that the site at Columb Barracks, Mullingar will transfer to the LDA. My Department has completed all the pre-contract paperwork to facilitate the transfer of the site as soon as the LDA is ready to accept the site.",
