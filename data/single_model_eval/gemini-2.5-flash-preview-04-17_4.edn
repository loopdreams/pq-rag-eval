   "As the Deputy is aware, Management and Administration staff in the HSE, represented by Fórsa, began a work-to-rule on the 6th of October 2023, in response to a HSE recruitment pause in their category of staff. The work-to-rule instructions, which have been issued to members by Fórsa, includes an instruction to not respond to Parliamentary Questions. I understand that all Parliamentary Questions are being compiled and filed appropriately by HSE officials to be managed, if necessary, at such time as the work-to-rule is lifted.  When Fórsa's Management and Admin work-to-rule began, the recruitment pause applied only to this category of staff. Since then, as the Deputy is aware, the pause has been extended to include most staff categories, excluding Consultant appointments and Graduate Nurses and Midwives and Doctors in formal approved Training Programmes. Recruitment across the HSE has been very strong in 2023. The Government funded the HSE to recruit to over 6000 new posts in 2023 to support the development of services.  The HSE has reached that target before the end of the year, and this is why a temporary pause has been put in place.  If this level of growth was allowed to continue uncontrolled, the HSE would be significantly over the targeted and budgeted recruitment figure by year end which will have financial implications for 2023 and following years, and adversely impact on the HSE’s ability to recruit essential patient facing clinical staff. There is agreement to recruit further 2,260 new posts in 2024. A series of engagements have taken place in the Workplace Relations Commission between the HSE, the Department of Health and Fórsa in an effort to resolve the dispute. Health management remain open to engaging with Fórsa and I urge Fórsa to stand down their industrial action in the interests of the health service. "

  ["In it’s 2017 publication “Cannabis for Medical Use – A Scientific Review” the Health Products Regulatory Authority found that at that time• There was an absence of scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness (efficacy) of cannabis products.  The safety of cannabis as a medical treatment is not well characterised.  • There was insufficient information on its safety during long term use for the treatment of chronic medical conditions, such as those for which there is a public interest.  • Most cannabis products available under international access schemes did not meet pharmaceutical quality requirements and were not capable of being authorised as medicinal products (medicines).  • There was a significant gap between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine. • Any proposal to circumvent the medicines regulatory system, established by law, would require careful consideration, so as to avoid unintended consequences, and lower standards of patient protection.   • The HPRA advised that if the policy decision was to make cannabis available for medical purposes, that it should recognise patient need, but be evidence based.  • It was advised that treatment with cannabis be only permitted under a controlled access programme for the treatment of patients with; • Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions whilst under expert medical supervision; • Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes whilst under expert medical supervision; • Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications whilst under expert medical supervision.      It was also recommended that the MCAP be a 5 year pilot project subject to review. After the necessary legislation was put in place and products sources for the programme the MCAP commenced in 2021. Given the time elapsed since the initial publication the decision was taken to commence an evidence review before the 5 years pilot period had been completed. The current review consists of an evidence gathering, evidence synthesis and finally a clinical review to determine if evidence exists to expand the scope of the programme. In the circumstances it is appropriate to wait for the findings of the clinical review group before any decisions are taken whether or not to expand the conditions covered by the programme."
   "The identity of clinicians who either apply for a Ministerial Licence or to enter the Cannabis for Medical Use Register for the purpose of treating their patients is confidential and will not be made public. The products available to MCAP patients are defined as \"specified controlled drugs\" S.I. No. 262/2019 - Misuse Of Drugs (Prescription And Control Of Supply Of Cannabis For Medical Use) Regulations 2019, and are contained in Schedule 1 of the Regulations as set out below and are covered by the Long |Term Illness, GMS or Medical Card as appropriate.   The MCAP review is anticipated to be completed in 2024."
   "At the outset I must stress to the Deputy that the Health Research Board (HRB) did not conduct a clinical review of the Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP). The HRB, at the request of the Department of Health, was requested to ascertain whether there is sufficient evidence to broaden the scope of the 3 conditions which could be treated with cannabis-based products under the MCAP. The exercise consisted of an initial evidence gathering and a subsequent evidence synthesis, the results of which were published in January. The HRB’s publication does not make any recommendations, as explained above that was not its purpose. A clinical review group will examine the findings of the evidence synthesis publication to determine if there is sufficient evidence to expand the range of conditions covered by the MCAP. In these circumstances it is appropriate to wait for the recommendations of the clinical review group."
   "A Ministerial Licence issued pursuant to Section 14 for the Misuse of Drugs entitles the clinician licensee to prescribe, import, supply , possess and administer a cannabis-based product containing Tetrahydrocannabinol.  The decision on what to prescribe is a clinical decision in which neither the Minister for Health nor the Department of Health has a role.  As the products are Schedule 1 controlled drugs in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017 the necessary licences must be in place under the Misuse of Drugs Act, other than the clinicians, for possession and supply of the prescribed cannabis-based products by other stakeholders if required."
   "The HPRA, in their 2017 report \"Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review\" stated that if cannabis products that are not capable of being authorised as medicines, are made available through an access programme, patients and healthcare professionals must recognise the limitations of the programme in assuring the safety, quality and effectiveness, as compared with what would be expected for an authorised medicine. There appears to be a significant gap between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine. Any proposal to circumvent the medicines regulatory system, established by law, would require careful consideration, so as to avoid unintended consequences, and lower standards of patient protection. At that time it was recommended that an Access Programme be for the treatment of three stated conditions: 1. Refractory Epilepsy; 2. Spasticity as a result of Multiple Sclerosis; and  3. Nausea as a result of chemotherapy. The MCAP was intended to be run on a 5 year pilot basis, subject to review. Given the passage of time since the initial recommendation the review was brought forward to ascertain if currently there is sufficient evidence to expand the scope of the programme. It is anticipated that the work of the clinical review group will be completed in the second quarter of 2024."],

The safety of cannabis as a medical treatment is not well characterised.  • There was insufficient information on its safety during long term use for the treatment of chronic medical conditions, such as those for which there is a public interest.  • Most cannabis products available under international access schemes did not meet pharmaceutical quality requirements and were not capable of being authorised as medicinal products (medicines).  • There was a significant gap between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine. • Any proposal to circumvent the medicines regulatory system, established by law, would require careful consideration, so as to avoid unintended consequences, and lower standards of patient protection.   • The HPRA advised that if the policy decision was to make cannabis available for medical purposes, that it should recognise patient need, but be evidence based.  • It was advised that treatment with cannabis be only permitted under a controlled access programme for the treatment of patients with; • Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions whilst under expert medical supervision; • Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes whilst under expert medical supervision; • Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications whilst under expert medical supervision.      It was also recommended that the MCAP be a 5 year pilot project subject to review. After the necessary legislation was put in place and products sources for the programme the MCAP commenced in 2021. Given the time elapsed since the initial publication the decision was taken to commence an evidence review before the 5 years pilot period had been completed. The current review consists of an evidence gathering, evidence synthesis and finally a clinical review to determine if evidence exists to expand the scope of the programme. In the circumstances it is appropriate to wait for the findings of the clinical review group before any decisions are taken whether or not to expand the conditions covered by the programme.\n\nThe identity of clinicians who either apply for a Ministerial Licence or to enter the Cannabis for Medical Use Register for the purpose of treating their patients is confidential and will not be made public. The products available to MCAP patients are defined as \"specified controlled drugs\" S.I. No. 262/2019 - Misuse Of Drugs (Prescription And Control Of Supply Of Cannabis For Medical Use) Regulations 2019, and are contained in Schedule 1 of the Regulations as set out below and are covered by the Long |Term Illness, GMS or Medical Card as appropriate.   The MCAP review is anticipated to be completed in 2024.\n\nAt the outset I must stress to the Deputy that the Health Research Board (HRB) did not conduct a clinical review of the Medical Cannabis Access Programme (MCAP). The HRB, at the request of the Department of Health, was requested to ascertain whether there is sufficient evidence to broaden the scope of the 3 conditions which could be treated with cannabis-based products under the MCAP. The exercise consisted of an initial evidence gathering and a subsequent evidence synthesis, the results of which were published in January. The HRB’s publication does not make any recommendations, as explained above that was not its purpose. A clinical review group will examine the findings of the evidence synthesis publication to determine if there is sufficient evidence to expand the range of conditions covered by the MCAP. In these circumstances it is appropriate to wait for the recommendations of the clinical review group.\n\nA Ministerial Licence issued pursuant to Section 14 for the Misuse of Drugs entitles the clinician licensee to prescribe, import, supply , possess and administer a cannabis-based product containing Tetrahydrocannabinol.  The decision on what to prescribe is a clinical decision in which neither the Minister for Health nor the Department of Health has a role.  As the products are Schedule 1 controlled drugs in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017 the necessary licences must be in place under the Misuse of Drugs Act, other than the clinicians, for possession and supply of the prescribed cannabis-based products by other stakeholders if required.\n\nThe HPRA, in their 2017 report \"Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review\" stated that if cannabis products that are not capable of being authorised as medicines, are made available through an access programme, patients and healthcare professionals must recognise the limitations of the programme in assuring the safety, quality and effectiveness, as compared with what would be expected for an authorised medicine. There appears to be a significant gap between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine. Any proposal to circumvent the medicines regulatory system, established by law, would require careful consideration, so as to avoid unintended consequences, and lower standards of patient protection. At that time it was recommended that an Access Programme be for the treatment of three stated conditions: 1. Refractory Epilepsy; 2. Spasticity as a result of Multiple Sclerosis; and  3. Nausea as a result of chemotherapy. The MCAP was intended to be run on a 5 year pilot basis, subject to review. Given the passage of time since the initial recommendation the review was brought forward to ascertain if currently there is sufficient evidence to expand the scope of the programme. It is anticipated that the work of the clinical review group will be completed in the second quarter of 2024.",

   "The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003.  My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects. Louth County Council has indicated that Dunleer remains their top priority project, and a new fire station at Dunleer is provided for in the Fire services Capital Programme 2021 - 2025. The Council submitted a preliminary appraisal to my Department in January 2021. Following examination of the proposal, approval in principle for this project issued on 25 June 2021, along with approval for the Council to appoint a design team and to progress this project to full design and cost plan stage. Louth County Council are working to finalise the acquisition of their preferred site. Upon final confirmation of site acquisition, Louth County Council will move quickly through the necessary phases to progress the construction of a new station for Dunleer.

   "My Department supports fire authorities by establishing policy, setting national standards for fire safety and fire service provision, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects and the procurement of essential frontline fire appliances, ancillary vehicles and equipment. Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 local authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters. In December 2020 I announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme under which a total of 35 “Class B” fire appliances were allocated across the fire authorities. It was envisaged that through an extension of that framework an additional allocation of appliances would be proposed for the period 2024-2025. Unfortunately, due to COVID and issues in the market such as the lengthening of supply chains and cost inflation, the previous framework became unviable economically for the commercial partners. My Department re-engaged with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and established a new framework for the provision of fire appliances. The three successful tenderers were HPMP Ltd. (Carlow), Sídheán Teo. (Galway), and Emergency One (UK) Ltd. (Scotland). The new Framework commenced with the awarding of contracts for the supply of the revised number of 40 “Class B Fire” appliances, at a cost of some €20.8 million, from 18 October 2023, to be allocated across the country's 27 Local Authority and Rescue Services. It is envisaged that contracts will be divided in three tranches in 2023/2024. Tipperary Fire and Rescue Service have been allocated 2 appliances under this programme. The previous joint procurement programme which ran from 2018-2020 supplied 23 new appliances to 20 local authorities at a cost of approximately €9.2 million. Tipperary Fire and Rescue Service received 2 appliance under this programme. "
   "A General Scheme of a Bill to update the Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003 is being prepared within my Department. The primary purpose of this legislation will be to update the Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003. The shape of the Bill has been considered on a number of occasions by the Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). The Board is comprised of Chief Executive Officers from local authorities, the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) as well as representatives of Government Departments and other bodies.  There is a need for further consultation with relevant stakeholders to ensure the Bill ultimately brought forward is comprehensive, robust and future-proofed. The intention of the Bill is to support and strengthen the role of local authorities in the delivery of fire services.  The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises, is a statutory function of each individual fire authority.  The work of local authority fire services has, to a large degree, been underpinned by the Fire Services Act 1981 & 2003 for nearly 40 years.  While this legislation has served the country well, and key indicators such as fatalities from fire per million of population have continued to fall consistently to the point where they are at their lowest for forty years, it is appropriate now to ensure that the underpinning legislation fully reflects the changes in society and the expanded and more dynamic roles that our local authority fire services have taken on in recent years.   Like all legislation, this is a complex piece of work, which necessitates consideration of multifaceted issues that impact on a number of different sectors. When my Department is satisfied that the legislation being brought forward is appropriate, balanced, complete and robust, a Memorandum will be brought to Government on the issue, followed by publication of the Bill."

  ["As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda Síochána, including all operational policing matters. As Minister, I have no role in these matters, nor can I direct the Commissioner with regard to them.  As referred to by the Deputy in the additional clarification provided to my Department, I made enquiries with the Garda authorities in relation to the number of vetting applications received in respect to Local Authority Housing.  I understand that Section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for Local Authorities to obtain criminal record checks in respect of persons applying for housing.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Vetting Bureau has no role in any vetting carried out in respect of individual applicants for Local Authority housing.  I am further advised that these requests are processed on a case-by-case basis by the local Superintendent in charge of the District wherein the subject of the request resides. I am further advised that guidance in respect of the application of section 15 is provided for in HQ Directive 136/97."
   "The Government is committed to building stronger, safer communities – and strengthening An Garda Síochána is at the core of that. We will continue to provide An Garda Síochána with the resources it needs to ensure communities around Ireland are safe and feel safe, including to invest in recruitment, in equipment and technology and in buildings.  Budget 2024 provides an allocation of €2.3 billion to An Garda Síochána – this is a 23% increase since 2020. This funding allows for the continued recruitment of Garda members and staff.   As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, including the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff, under Section 26 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended). As Minister, I have no direct role in the Garda recruitment process.  I can confirm that while my Department has not commissioned any surveys regarding Garda recruitment, we continue to monitor all aspects of Garda recruitment and retention. Additionally, I have regular meetings with the Garda Commissioner to discuss all Garda matters, including recruitment, and there is ongoing engagement between officials in my Department and Garda senior management on such issues. The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that An Garda Síochána are devising a recruitment and retention strategy for the organisation. In 2023 we saw recruitment into An Garda Síochána gain real momentum. And with unprecedented funding recently allocated for equipment and wellbeing initiatives, and recent increases in frontline supervisors, I believe those who join will be supported as they take on what I know can be a challenging job. The Deputy will also be aware that this year's Garda recruitment campaign opened on Monday, 15 January and will close on Thursday, 8 February.  We have significantly increased the training allowance for trainee Gardaí, to €305 per week. Given that, and the decision to increase the maximum age of recruitment from 35 to 50, I believe we are opening up policing as a career option to a new cohort of people who will bring a range of different life and career experiences to the table. Policing is a career in which no two days will be the same. It can be exciting, rewarding and undoubtedly challenging, but it offers a great opportunity to have a positive impact in the community and to be a part of a modern, inclusive police service that has the respect and trust of the Irish public. I encourage anyone who believes they can make a positive contribution as a Garda to consider putting their name forward."
   "I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Garda authorities. Unfortunately, the information was not received in time. I will contact the Deputy directly once the information is to hand."
   "The Public Appointments Service (PAS) manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda staff, including interviews, on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. As Minister I have no role in this matter. I am advised by the Garda authorities that there were 7,735 valid applications for the Garda Clerical Officer 2023 competition.  I am informed that the first round of interviews took place in December 2023 for six priority counties. I am advised that over 60 candidates were offered roles and are currently progressing through the vetting process.  Garda authorities and the Public Appointments Service will continue to interview candidates throughout the lifetime of the competition (up to the end of December 2025).  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda authorities avail of all opportunities to reassign Gardaí out of administrative roles, where appropriate. However, it should be noted that not all Garda staff recruitment results in the freeing up of a Garda equivalent.  As the appointment of successful candidates has only commenced, and in light of the above, I am informed that in this instance no Gardaí have yet been reassigned to operational duties as a result of this competition."
   "The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs to fight crime. An Garda Síochána has been allocated unprecedented funding of over €2.35 billion for 2024 – this is a 25% increase since 2020. This funding will allow for the continued recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the administration and management of An Garda Síochána, including for the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff. As Minister, I have no role in such matters. The Deputy may also be aware that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) administers the initial stages of any recruitment competition for An Garda Síochána on behalf of the Commissioner. PAS is the independent body responsible for public service recruitment under the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The table below, furnished to me by the Garda authorities, outlines the number of Garda applicants, the number that enrolled in the Garda college and the number of Probationer Gardaí who attested in 2020 up to end December 2023.  For the Deputy's information, there were no competitions for Garda recruit in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There were 746 entrants into the Garda College in 2023. This is the largest intake into the Garda college since 2018.

If you can't find any information in the context to answer\n       the question, then reply with \"I am unable to answer this question with\n       the information I have available.\" \n\n CONTEXT: As the Deputy will be aware, in accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda Síochána, including all operational policing matters. As Minister, I have no role in these matters, nor can I direct the Commissioner with regard to them.  As referred to by the Deputy in the additional clarification provided to my Department, I made enquiries with the Garda authorities in relation to the number of vetting applications received in respect to Local Authority Housing.  I understand that Section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for Local Authorities to obtain criminal record checks in respect of persons applying for housing.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Vetting Bureau has no role in any vetting carried out in respect of individual applicants for Local Authority housing.  I am further advised that these requests are processed on a case-by-case basis by the local Superintendent in charge of the District wherein the subject of the request resides. I am further advised that guidance in respect of the application of section 15 is provided for in HQ Directive 136/97.\n\nThe Government is committed to building stronger, safer communities – and strengthening An Garda Síochána is at the core of that. We will continue to provide An Garda Síochána with the resources it needs to ensure communities around Ireland are safe and feel safe, including to invest in recruitment, in equipment and technology and in buildings.  Budget 2024 provides an allocation of €2.3 billion to An Garda Síochána – this is a 23% increase since 2020. This funding allows for the continued recruitment of Garda members and staff.   As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, including the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff, under Section 26 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended). As Minister, I have no direct role in the Garda recruitment process.  I can confirm that while my Department has not commissioned any surveys regarding Garda recruitment, we continue to monitor all aspects of Garda recruitment and retention. Additionally, I have regular meetings with the Garda Commissioner to discuss all Garda matters, including recruitment, and there is ongoing engagement between officials in my Department and Garda senior management on such issues. The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that An Garda Síochána are devising a recruitment and retention strategy for the organisation. In 2023 we saw recruitment into An Garda Síochána gain real momentum. And with unprecedented funding recently allocated for equipment and wellbeing initiatives, and recent increases in frontline supervisors, I believe those who join will be supported as they take on what I know can be a challenging job. The Deputy will also be aware that this year's Garda recruitment campaign opened on Monday, 15 January and will close on Thursday, 8 February.  We have significantly increased the training allowance for trainee Gardaí, to €305 per week. Given that, and the decision to increase the maximum age of recruitment from 35 to 50, I believe we are opening up policing as a career option to a new cohort of people who will bring a range of different life and career experiences to the table. Policing is a career in which no two days will be the same. It can be exciting, rewarding and undoubtedly challenging, but it offers a great opportunity to have a positive impact in the community and to be a part of a modern, inclusive police service that has the respect and trust of the Irish public. I encourage anyone who believes they can make a positive contribution as a Garda to consider putting their name forward.\n\nI have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Garda authorities. Unfortunately, the information was not received in time. I will contact the Deputy directly once the information is to hand.\n\nThe Public Appointments Service (PAS) manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda staff, including interviews, on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. As Minister I have no role in this matter. I am advised by the Garda authorities that there were 7,735 valid applications for the Garda Clerical Officer 2023 competition.  I am informed that the first round of interviews took place in December 2023 for six priority counties. I am advised that over 60 candidates were offered roles and are currently progressing through the vetting process.  Garda authorities and the Public Appointments Service will continue to interview candidates throughout the lifetime of the competition (up to the end of December 2025).  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda authorities avail of all opportunities to reassign Gardaí out of administrative roles, where appropriate. However, it should be noted that not all Garda staff recruitment results in the freeing up of a Garda equivalent.  As the appointment of successful candidates has only commenced, and in light of the above, I am informed that in this instance no Gardaí have yet been reassigned to operational duties as a result of this competition.\n\nThe Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs to fight crime. An Garda Síochána has been allocated unprecedented funding of over €2.35 billion for 2024 – this is a 25% increase since 2020. This funding will allow for the continued recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the administration and management of An Garda Síochána, including for the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff. As Minister, I have no role in such matters. The Deputy may also be aware that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) administers the initial stages of any recruitment competition for An Garda Síochána on behalf of the Commissioner. PAS is the independent body responsible for public service recruitment under the provisions of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The table below, furnished to me by the Garda authorities, outlines the number of Garda applicants, the number that enrolled in the Garda college and the number of Probationer Gardaí who attested in 2020 up to end December 2023.  For the Deputy's information, there were no competitions for Garda recruit in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There were 746 entrants into the Garda College in 2023. This is the largest intake into the Garda college since 2018.   As the Deputy may be aware, in 2022 an individual could simply send an expression of interest to PAS to enrol in Garda College, whereas in 2023 a more substantial application was required.",

   "The Innovation Voucher Programme is funded by my Department under the Science and Technology Programme, through Enterprise Ireland.  The Innovation Voucher Programme is designed to build links between Ireland's public knowledge providers (higher education institutions and research performing bodies) and small businesses and help to create a cultural shift in the small business community's approach to innovation. The vouchers encourage companies and public knowledge providers to work together on specific innovation questions and projects related to a company’s needs and is available to the broadest number of companies.  The nature of these projects will be such that they transfer knowledge that is new, thereby enabling a company to use this newly acquired knowledge to innovate a product, production process or service.  As part of the Budget 2024 allocation to my Department, my officials, have been working in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland to review the Innovation Voucher Programme, including increasing the value of the vouchers from €5,000 up to €10,000.  It is anticipated that this increase in the value of the voucher will be implemented in Q2 of this year.

   "Section 9 of the Irish Sign Language (ISL) Act, 2017 assigns responsibility to the Minister for Social Protection to provide funds to facilitate users of ISL to access social, educational and cultural events and services (including medical) and other activities.  I assigned the implementation of this responsibility to the Citizens Information Board (CIB), the statutory body under the aegis of my Department, which in turn assigned delivery to its Service Delivery Company, the Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS).

   "As the Deputy may be aware, the CIÉ Group is actively engaged in introducing changes to their pension schemes aimed at rectifying the significant deficit in order to meet the statutory Minimum Funding Standard (MFS) required by the Pensions Authority. The changes also aim to sustain the pension schemes into the long-term. As of end December 2022, the Balance Sheet deficit for the two defined benefit pension schemes operated by CIÉ, namely the Regular Wages Scheme (“RWS”) and 1951 superannuation scheme (“1951 Scheme”), was €396.5m. While the funding position improved during 2022, and the 1951 scheme now meets the MFS, the RWS currently does not meet the MFS and the funding level is marginal and subject to future market volatility. In relation to RWS, I signed three Statutory Instruments related to the RWS on 6th July 2022, with an operative date of 18th July 2022. Regarding the 1951 Scheme, CIÉ has prepared and submitted a draft SI to give effect to Labour Court recommendations for the 1951 Scheme, as passed by ballot of trade union members in May 2021. This is being considered by the Department in conjunction with NewERA. The Deputy may also be aware that the rules governing the 1951 scheme are currently subject to ongoing legal proceedings before the Commercial Court. The Hearing commenced on 24 May 2022 for 4 days, and the proceedings are next listed for the 24th of April 2024. Concerning pension increases for CIÉ pensioners, I understand that an increase for pensioners would only be possible when the Schemes are capable of sustaining such increases. Furthermore, any such proposal would be dependent on the advice of the Scheme Actuary at the time an increase is proposed, and is done in agreement with the Trustees of the Schemes.

This represents an 107% increase on B2 upgrades supported in 2022.• Under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme 5,897 free upgrades for energy poor homes were delivered. This represents an 33% increase in free upgrades provided versus 2022. • Final capital spend in 2023 for Subhead B4 was €324.5m, this compares to 2022 expenditure of €192.4m equating to a year-on-year increase of 68%• 18 OSSs are now registered.• In addition, 67,411 applications for grant support were received by SEAI equating to a 34% increase on 2022 levels. This indicates a strong pipeline of works for 2024. It should be noted that in line with the respective terms and conditions of the various SEAI energy efficiency schemes, not all homeowners are not required to have a pre-works Building Energy Rating (BER) to qualify for grant support:• Better Energy Homes and Solar PV Schemes: homeowners are not required to have a pre-works Building Energy Rating (BER) to qualify for grant support, and for this reason data on the average energy uplift is not available for homes upgraded under these schemes.• Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme: Pre-works BER data is only available from 2023. • National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme and Community Energy Grant Scheme: A pre-works BER is required for all homes. Regarding the requested information on the average energy uplift for properties upgraded under the SEAI energy efficiency schemes: • Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme: the average energy uplift in 2023 was E2 to C3. • National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme (including pilots):  the average energy uplift in 2023 was D2 to A3, and in 2022 it was from D1 to A3. • Community Energy Grants scheme: the average energy uplift in 2023 was D2 to A2, and in 2022 it was from D2 to A3.

   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 141 together. The Climate Action Plan and National Retrofit Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2/cost optimal and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by end-2030. The SEAI advises that heat pump heating systems are most efficient when they operate in homes with a low level of heat loss. The metric used to determine whether the dwelling has a sufficiently low level of heat loss is the “Heat Loss Indicator” (HLI).   In order to avail of the heat pump grant, a homeowner must first get an SEAI registered Technical Advisor to carry out an assessment of their home. This assesses the suitability of the premises for a heat pump or whether any other upgrades are necessary. In some instances, the additional upgrades required will qualify for SEAI grants.   In addition, under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme (NHEUS), since February 2022 grant support has been made available for homeowners to have a more wide-ranging Home Energy Assessment (HEA) carried out which provides information on: Pre-works BER; HLI & Heat Pump design; Design for upgrade to BER B2 and beyond; and Cost estimate quotes and grants available. The HEA is especially recommended if a heat pump is being installed as part of a whole-of-home retrofit project. It is important to note that a home does not fail a heat pump assessment - rather the assessment identifies the elements that require upgrading in the home for the installation of a heat pump. An independent Technical Advisor, who is registered with SEAI, is engaged by the homeowner. The Technical Advisor guides the homeowner on: the energy performance of the dwelling; the suitability of the dwelling for a heat pump system based on the dwelling’s heat loss; and measures necessary to ensure that the dwelling fabric heat loss is lowered to an acceptable level for a heat pump system to perform effectively and efficiently. SEAI has also commenced a Residential Heat Pump and Heat Loss Indicator research study involving up to 1,000 homes to test the performance of heat pumps across homes with a higher level of heat loss than is currently required by SEAI for grant support.  The Pilot remains open to homeowners wishing to participate. SEAI has advised my Department that the scheme has launched and results from participating homes are expected in 2025. Pending the findings of the study, this could allow heat pumps to be installed in many more homes currently deemed ineligible.   Available data provided by SEAI regarding Heat Pumps assessments can be found in the below tables. It should be noted that an application may be made in one year and paid in another.         "
   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) operates the Warmer Homes Scheme on behalf of my Department. Delivering free energy upgrades to low-income households and reducing the waiting times for the Warmer Homes Scheme is a top priority for my Department and the SEAI. My officials continue to work with the SEAI to maximise and accelerate the output of free energy upgrades provided under this important scheme. In recent years, the Warmer Homes Scheme has delivered a greater volume of deeper and more complex upgrades. This is reflected in the average cost of upgrades which have seen an almost tenfold increase from €2,600 in 2015 to €24,000 in 2023. These deeper upgrades mean that more lower income homeowners are benefitting significantly from warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and reduced emissions. However, it is important to acknowledge that deeper retrofits take longer to complete. This improvement in the upgrades provided under the scheme in tandem with increased awareness of the multiple benefits of retrofit are driving significantly increased levels of demand. Approximately 24,000 applications from homeowners were received in 2022 and 2023 combined. For the homes completed in 2023, the average waiting time from application to completion was 20 months. This is a reduction from 26 months for homes completed in 2022. Table 1 below sets out the number of homes completed in each of the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 to end January. Table 2 sets out the number of homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are:• currently undergoing works; • have been allocated to contractors for works; • have completed an initial home survey;• are awaiting allocation to a contractor; or• are awaiting the initial survey of their home.

   "The monitoring of operational standards in Uisce Éireann is a matter for which I have no function.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is statutorily tasked with monitoring Uisce Éireann's performance in accordance with section 39 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 (as amended).

   "Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has statutory responsibility for the National Driver Testing Service and the information requested on specific centres is held by the agency. I have therefore referred the question to the RSA for direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response is not received within 10 days. Regarding driver testing delays, the service has been under significant pressure to meet unprecedented demand. Anticipating ongoing demand pressures and following a request for additional resources last year, my Department gave approval for the recruitment of up to 75 additional driver testers. This brings the total number of sanctioned driver tester posts to 205 in 2023, which is more than double the 100 sanctioned testing posts in June 2022.The first tranche of new recruits were deployed last September and the national average waiting time for invitation to test has been decreasing since then. By the end of 2023 there was an increase of 41 driver testers allocated across the driver testing service with a focus on geographical areas with the longest waiting times and highest demand for tests. Sanction remains in place for the Authority to increase the number of testers on temporary contracts to further alleviate current pressures on the service. My Department is working closely with the Authority to monitor demand and capacity requirements of the driver testing service to ensure it meets the agreed service level of average wait times of 10 weeks, which the Authority expects to achieve by mid-2024."

   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 303 to 308, inclusive, together. It is my vision that Irish education continues to innovate, improve, and inspire. In September 2023, I announced an acceleration to my ambitious programme for Senior Cycle Redevelopment. In this new phase of the programme, there will be an accelerated national roll-out of the revised subject specifications for seven existing Leaving Certificate Established subjects within Tranche One in September 2025, two years sooner than previously announced. This acceleration will serve a greater number of Leaving Certificate students.  These subjects are Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Arabic, Latin, Ancient Greek, and Business. Part of these transformative developments include the introduction of the two new Senior Cycle subjects of Drama, Film and Theatre Studies, and Climate Action and Sustainable Development. These two new subjects will be introduced on a phased basis, initially across a small network of schools, at the beginning of the school year 2025/26. For new and revised subject in Tranche 1, a comprehensive programme of teacher professional learning will commence in the 2024/25 school year, the year prior to teaching and learning commencing in schools.  The second tranche of revised subjects, to be introduced to schools at the beginning of the 2026/27 school year, are Accounting, Construction Studies, Engineering, English, Geography, LCVP Link Modules, and Physical Education. Teacher professional learning for the second tranche of revised subjects will commence in the year prior to teaching and learning in schools. The schedule of revised specifications to be introduced in the first two tranches have been published on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) website. It is expected that details for the remaining annual tranches will be published shortly. They will be available on the NCCA website: ncca.ie/en/senior-cycle/senior-cycle-redevelopment/schedule-of-senior-cycle-subjects-for-redevelopment/. As the Deputy is aware, each of the new subject specifications will incorporate externally assessed components that are not a traditional written examination, referred to as additional assessment components (AACs). These components will be externally assessed by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and will be worth at least 40% of the available marks.  The AACs aim to reduce the pressure on students that comes from final assessments based primarily on written examinations conducted at the end of sixth year. This is in response to significant engagement with education stakeholders, including representatives of students, teachers, parents, school leadership, management bodies, and subject experts. Importantly, these AACs will be designed to assess students’ skills and key competencies, developed through the study of their chosen subject, in a way that a terminal written examination can not. This model of adopting a broader range of assessment types, over a less concentrated time period is in line with international best practice. It builds on existing assessment practices for many current Leaving Certificate subjects that have assessment components in addition to terminal examinations such as oral and aural examinations, practical examinations, coursework, and performances.  The nature and timing of AACs in each subject will be agreed upon by subject experts in the NCCA’s subject development groups and outlined in the subject specifications; having regard to the timing of AAC submission dates in other subjects. These subject specifications will articulate what the students are required to do, the form(s) in which it can be carried out and submitted and the workload expectations associated with the AAC. The alignment of the coursework assessment to a particular set of learning outcomes from the subject specification will be provided, as well as details on which key competencies and associated learning outcomes will be assessed.  Details will be provided on the nature of the assessment component which could, for example, take the form of a research project/extended essay, oral assessment, performance assessment, portfolio assessment, creation of an artefact, field study, or an experiment/proof of concept/practical investigation.  The consultations for all nine draft subject specifications are now open on the NCCA website. Consultation on the three draft science specifications, and three draft classical languages specifications will conclude on 23 February 2024. Consultation on the draft Business specifications and the two new subjects opened on 2 February 2024 and will conclude on 5 April 2024. Details of the AACs being proposed for each of these subjects is detailed in each specification  ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2023/december/consultation-open-leaving-certificate-sciences/  ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2023/december/consultation-open-leaving-certificate-arabic-and-classical-languages/ ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2024/february-5/3-draft-specifications-consultation/  I have asked the SEC to commission research on generative AI in the context of teacher-based assessment.

  "You are a responsible and trustworthy senior government official.\n       Provide an answer to the user's question, using only the context\n       provided. Answer as if you are talking directly to the user and make sure\n       the answer is neutral and formal. If you can't find the specific detail\n       that the user is looking for from the question, acknowledge this and\n       provide other helpful information from the context that may be related to\n       the question. If you can't find any information in the context to answer\n       the question, then reply with \"I am unable to answer this question with\n       the information I have available.\" \n\n CONTEXT: The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the state examinations.  In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.\n\nThe monitoring of operational standards in Uisce Éireann is a matter for which I have no function.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is statutorily tasked with monitoring Uisce Éireann's performance in accordance with section 39 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 (as amended).  I have asked the CRU to respond directly on this matter.   The CRU has a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members: at oireachtas@cru.ie.\n\nUnder the Road Safety Authority Act 2006, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has statutory responsibility for the National Driver Testing Service and the information requested on specific centres is held by the agency. I have therefore referred the question to the RSA for direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response is not received within 10 days. Regarding driver testing delays, the service has been under significant pressure to meet unprecedented demand. Anticipating ongoing demand pressures and following a request for additional resources last year, my Department gave approval for the recruitment of up to 75 additional driver testers. This brings the total number of sanctioned driver tester posts to 205 in 2023, which is more than double the 100 sanctioned testing posts in June 2022.The first tranche of new recruits were deployed last September and the national average waiting time for invitation to test has been decreasing since then. By the end of 2023 there was an increase of 41 driver testers allocated across the driver testing service with a focus on geographical areas with the longest waiting times and highest demand for tests. Sanction remains in place for the Authority to increase the number of testers on temporary contracts to further alleviate current pressures on the service. My Department is working closely with the Authority to monitor demand and capacity requirements of the driver testing service to ensure it meets the agreed service level of average wait times of 10 weeks, which the Authority expects to achieve by mid-2024.\n\nThe State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the state examinations.  In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you. \n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 303 to 308, inclusive, together. It is my vision that Irish education continues to innovate, improve, and inspire. In September 2023, I announced an acceleration to my ambitious programme for Senior Cycle Redevelopment. In this new phase of the programme, there will be an accelerated national roll-out of the revised subject specifications for seven existing Leaving Certificate Established subjects within Tranche One in September 2025, two years sooner than previously announced. This acceleration will serve a greater number of Leaving Certificate students.  These subjects are Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Arabic, Latin, Ancient Greek, and Business. Part of these transformative developments include the introduction of the two new Senior Cycle subjects of Drama, Film and Theatre Studies, and Climate Action and Sustainable Development. These two new subjects will be introduced on a phased basis, initially across a small network of schools, at the beginning of the school year 2025/26. For new and revised subject in Tranche 1, a comprehensive programme of teacher professional learning will commence in the 2024/25 school year, the year prior to teaching and learning commencing in schools.  The second tranche of revised subjects, to be introduced to schools at the beginning of the 2026/27 school year, are Accounting, Construction Studies, Engineering, English, Geography, LCVP Link Modules, and Physical Education. Teacher professional learning for the second tranche of revised subjects will commence in the year prior to teaching and learning in schools. The schedule of revised specifications to be introduced in the first two tranches have been published on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) website. It is expected that details for the remaining annual tranches will be published shortly. They will be available on the NCCA website: ncca.ie/en/senior-cycle/senior-cycle-redevelopment/schedule-of-senior-cycle-subjects-for-redevelopment/. As the Deputy is aware, each of the new subject specifications will incorporate externally assessed components that are not a traditional written examination, referred to as additional assessment components (AACs). These components will be externally assessed by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and will be worth at least 40% of the available marks.  The AACs aim to reduce the pressure on students that comes from final assessments based primarily on written examinations conducted at the end of sixth year. This is in response to significant engagement with education stakeholders, including representatives of students, teachers, parents, school leadership, management bodies, and subject experts. Importantly, these AACs will be designed to assess students’ skills and key competencies, developed through the study of their chosen subject, in a way that a terminal written examination can not. This model of adopting a broader range of assessment types, over a less concentrated time period is in line with international best practice. It builds on existing assessment practices for many current Leaving Certificate subjects that have assessment components in addition to terminal examinations such as oral and aural examinations, practical examinations, coursework, and performances.  The nature and timing of AACs in each subject will be agreed upon by subject experts in the NCCA’s subject development groups and outlined in the subject specifications; having regard to the timing of AAC submission dates in other subjects. These subject specifications will articulate what the students are required to do, the form(s) in which it can be carried out and submitted and the workload expectations associated with the AAC. The alignment of the coursework assessment to a particular set of learning outcomes from the subject specification will be provided, as well as details on which key competencies and associated learning outcomes will be assessed.  Details will be provided on the nature of the assessment component which could, for example, take the form of a research project/extended essay, oral assessment, performance assessment, portfolio assessment, creation of an artefact, field study, or an experiment/proof of concept/practical investigation.  The consultations for all nine draft subject specifications are now open on the NCCA website. Consultation on the three draft science specifications, and three draft classical languages specifications will conclude on 23 February 2024. Consultation on the draft Business specifications and the two new subjects opened on 2 February 2024 and will conclude on 5 April 2024. Details of the AACs being proposed for each of these subjects is detailed in each specification  ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2023/december/consultation-open-leaving-certificate-sciences/  ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2023/december/consultation-open-leaving-certificate-arabic-and-classical-languages/ ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2024/february-5/3-draft-specifications-consultation/  I have asked the SEC to commission research on generative AI in the context of teacher-based assessment. The scoping of this research project is underway. Timelines will be determined as part of the procurement process.  I hope the Deputy finds this information useful.",

   "The Long-Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions covered by the Scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions covered, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework. This Government has put a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services, advancing substantial policy, legislation and investment to deliver expanded eligibility. In 2022, a range of measures were delivered including the abolition of public inpatient charges for children, reductions in the Drug Payment Scheme threshold to €80 per month, and the introduction of free contraception for women aged 17-25. In 2023, a further range of measures facilitated better access to affordable, high-quality healthcare. These include an expansion of GP care without charges to children aged 6 and 7, and to people earning no more than the median household income, the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for adults, and the extension of the free contraception scheme to include women aged 26-30. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. Under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%."

In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.

Source: https://data.cso.ie/table/F4059\n\nThe Long-Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions covered by the Scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions covered, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework. This Government has put a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services, advancing substantial policy, legislation and investment to deliver expanded eligibility. In 2022, a range of measures were delivered including the abolition of public inpatient charges for children, reductions in the Drug Payment Scheme threshold to €80 per month, and the introduction of free contraception for women aged 17-25. In 2023, a further range of measures facilitated better access to affordable, high-quality healthcare.

Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Statutory Instrument No. 277 of 1971, put a limitation on Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970, in respect of the provision of medicines to those suffering from mental illness:  \"Arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines to persons suffering from mental illness in pursuance of section 59 (3) of the Act shall be made only in respect of persons under the age of 16 years.\" Therefore, the limitation on age currently applies to persons eligible for the LTI Scheme under the category of \"mental illness\"; the Scheme has operated on this basis since its inception.

  ["I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.Guided by the Central Policy Framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service, the Department of the Taoiseach launched a Blended Working Policy in November 2022 with staff members invited to submit applications for blended working arrangements. In general, all applications for blended working arrangements were facilitated subject to business needs. At end 2022, 45% of staff (112) had applied for formal remote working arrangements. At end 2023, the figure was 41% of staff.  The Department is committed to embracing opportunities for remote and blended working, to build a more dynamic, agile and responsive workforce, while sustaining strong standards of performance and high levels of productivity. The Department of the Taoiseach recognises that blended working can increase flexibility, improve health and wellbeing, and enhance work-life balance. The Department’s Blended Working Policy provides for a minimum attendance of three days per week in the office. In most cases where staff are working full-time this provides for two days per week working remotely. The gender breakdown of staff availing of blended working arrangements is 65% female / 35% male, which is aligned to the Department’s overall gender distribution.  The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO), the only body under the aegis of the Department, also provides for blended working arrangements. At end 2023, 88% of NESDO staff (16) availed of blended working, with staff required to attend in the office a minimum of two days per week. At end 2022, the figure was 87% of staff (15). The gender breakdown of staff in NESDO availing of blended working arrangements is 63% female / 37% male."

   "The bodies under the aegis of my Department have provided the information requested in relation to remote working in respect of 2022 and 2023 below.  The Central Bank of Ireland remains committed to having a hybrid working model in place that provides two-way flexibility to both employees and the organisation. The model allows the majority of roles (+90% of approximately 2,000 employees) to choose to work from home up to 50% of their working days each month, if the requirements of the role allow. The Bank does not track the work location of employees, rather their working patterns are agreed at the team level with their managers. There are a minority of roles (<10%) that are required to work onsite more frequently than 50% on the basis that core aspects of their role can only be delivered onsite. Employees can also choose to work onsite more than 50% of their working days if it is their preference to do so. In respect of the Credit Review Office, 3 staff members worked remotely in 2022 and 2023. All staff worked from home at least 1 day per week, with 21 hours being the average home working hours per week. In 2022, the gender breakdown of those working remotely was 100% female; in 2023 it was 66% female/33% male. The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) does not track remote working hours on an hourly basis, but rather the figures provided are estimated based on the Remote Working Policy which allows staff to access up to 3 days per week remote working (role dependent). The number of staff that worked remotely in 2022 and 2023 was 78.6 (FTE) and 83 (FTE) respectively. 95% of staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in 2022 while in 2023 this percentage was 96.5%. 1,745 hours on average were worked from home per week in 2022 and 1,843 in 2023. The gender breakdown in 2022 was 62% female/38% male and in 2023 it was 53% female/47% male.  The Investor Compensation Company DAC had 8 remote workers for each year in question. 100% of staff availed of working at least 1 day per week in both years. The average home working hours per week was 230 in 2022 and 175 in 2023. In both years, the gender breakdown of remote workers was 63% female/37% male. In the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC), 6 staff worked remotely in 2022 and 5 in 2023. In 2022, 100% off staff worked from home at least 1 day per week; the average remote working hours was 32 per staff member per week. In 2023, 83% off staff worked from home at least 1 day per week and worked on average 32 hours per staff member from home per week. For both years, the gender breakdown of remote workers was 80% male/20 female.Under the hybrid working policy of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) all employees are eligible to work from home up to 3 days per week (21.75 hours), subject to business requirements. Actual average home working hours varies from week to week. In 2022 and 2023, approximately 95% of staff worked remotely, with an average of 21.75 hours per staff member per week. The gender breakdown for both years was 52% Female/48% Male. The overall gender split, by reference to eligibility for remote working, is based on actual year end headcount. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General had 180 staff working remotely in 2022 and 174 in 2023. 99% of staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in 2022 while, this figure was 96% in 2023. On average, 20 hours per employee per week were worked from home in both years. The gender breakdown of remote workers was 51% male/49% female in 2022 and 50% male/50% female in 2023. In 2022, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners had 5,418 staff working remotely and 5,581 in 2023. 79% of staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in both years. The gender breakdown of remote workers for both years was 65% female/35% male. The average home working hours per week is based on a 7 hour working day, pro-rated for part time workers. Staff working from home are required to fulfil their contracted hours. This is in line with the Department of Public Expenditure, NPD Delivery and Reform’s Circular 14/2022 Revision of Working Hours in the Civil Service. All staff in the Tax Appeals Commission were formally given the option to avail of blended working from September 2022. This refers to working arrangements that involve a combination of working from the work premises and working remotely, based on an agreement between the employee and the manager, and approved through the application process. All staff have availed of blended working. The Commission’s physical office in Leeson Close continues to be the primary work place for all employees, and there is a requirement to attend the office on two specific days each week agreed with the manager; and/or on days as and when required. 33 staff worked remotely in 2022, working on average 693 hours per week. In 2023, 33 staff worked remotely, working on average 672 hours per week. All staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in both years. In 2022, the gender breakdown was 58% female/42% male and in 2023, the breakdown was 59% female/41% male."

The gender breakdown of staff in NESDO availing of blended working arrangements is 63% female / 37% male.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.Guided by the Central Policy Framework for Blended Working in the Civil Service, the Department of the Taoiseach launched a Blended Working Policy in November 2022 with staff members invited to submit applications for blended working arrangements. In general, all applications for blended working arrangements were facilitated subject to business needs. At end 2022, 45% of staff (112) had applied for formal remote working arrangements. At end 2023, the figure was 41% of staff.  The Department is committed to embracing opportunities for remote and blended working, to build a more dynamic, agile and responsive workforce, while sustaining strong standards of performance and high levels of productivity. The Department of the Taoiseach recognises that blended working can increase flexibility, improve health and wellbeing, and enhance work-life balance. The Department’s Blended Working Policy provides for a minimum attendance of three days per week in the office. In most cases where staff are working full-time this provides for two days per week working remotely. The gender breakdown of staff availing of blended working arrangements is 65% female / 35% male, which is aligned to the Department’s overall gender distribution.  The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO), the only body under the aegis of the Department, also provides for blended working arrangements. At end 2023, 88% of NESDO staff (16) availed of blended working, with staff required to attend in the office a minimum of two days per week. At end 2022, the figure was 87% of staff (15). The gender breakdown of staff in NESDO availing of blended working arrangements is 63% female / 37% male.\n\nThe bodies under the aegis of my Department have provided the information requested in relation to remote working in respect of 2022 and 2023 below.  The Central Bank of Ireland remains committed to having a hybrid working model in place that provides two-way flexibility to both employees and the organisation. The model allows the majority of roles (+90% of approximately 2,000 employees) to choose to work from home up to 50% of their working days each month, if the requirements of the role allow. The Bank does not track the work location of employees, rather their working patterns are agreed at the team level with their managers. There are a minority of roles (<10%) that are required to work onsite more frequently than 50% on the basis that core aspects of their role can only be delivered onsite. Employees can also choose to work onsite more than 50% of their working days if it is their preference to do so. In respect of the Credit Review Office, 3 staff members worked remotely in 2022 and 2023. All staff worked from home at least 1 day per week, with 21 hours being the average home working hours per week. In 2022, the gender breakdown of those working remotely was 100% female; in 2023 it was 66% female/33% male. The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) does not track remote working hours on an hourly basis, but rather the figures provided are estimated based on the Remote Working Policy which allows staff to access up to 3 days per week remote working (role dependent). The number of staff that worked remotely in 2022 and 2023 was 78.6 (FTE) and 83 (FTE) respectively. 95% of staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in 2022 while in 2023 this percentage was 96.5%. 1,745 hours on average were worked from home per week in 2022 and 1,843 in 2023. The gender breakdown in 2022 was 62% female/38% male and in 2023 it was 53% female/47% male.  The Investor Compensation Company DAC had 8 remote workers for each year in question. 100% of staff availed of working at least 1 day per week in both years. The average home working hours per week was 230 in 2022 and 175 in 2023. In both years, the gender breakdown of remote workers was 63% female/37% male. In the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC), 6 staff worked remotely in 2022 and 5 in 2023. In 2022, 100% off staff worked from home at least 1 day per week; the average remote working hours was 32 per staff member per week. In 2023, 83% off staff worked from home at least 1 day per week and worked on average 32 hours per staff member from home per week. For both years, the gender breakdown of remote workers was 80% male/20 female.Under the hybrid working policy of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) all employees are eligible to work from home up to 3 days per week (21.75 hours), subject to business requirements. Actual average home working hours varies from week to week. In 2022 and 2023, approximately 95% of staff worked remotely, with an average of 21.75 hours per staff member per week. The gender breakdown for both years was 52% Female/48% Male. The overall gender split, by reference to eligibility for remote working, is based on actual year end headcount. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General had 180 staff working remotely in 2022 and 174 in 2023. 99% of staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in 2022 while, this figure was 96% in 2023. On average, 20 hours per employee per week were worked from home in both years. The gender breakdown of remote workers was 51% male/49% female in 2022 and 50% male/50% female in 2023. In 2022, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners had 5,418 staff working remotely and 5,581 in 2023. 79% of staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in both years. The gender breakdown of remote workers for both years was 65% female/35% male. The average home working hours per week is based on a 7 hour working day, pro-rated for part time workers. Staff working from home are required to fulfil their contracted hours. This is in line with the Department of Public Expenditure, NPD Delivery and Reform’s Circular 14/2022 Revision of Working Hours in the Civil Service. All staff in the Tax Appeals Commission were formally given the option to avail of blended working from September 2022. This refers to working arrangements that involve a combination of working from the work premises and working remotely, based on an agreement between the employee and the manager, and approved through the application process. All staff have availed of blended working. The Commission’s physical office in Leeson Close continues to be the primary work place for all employees, and there is a requirement to attend the office on two specific days each week agreed with the manager; and/or on days as and when required. 33 staff worked remotely in 2022, working on average 693 hours per week. In 2023, 33 staff worked remotely, working on average 672 hours per week. All staff worked from home at least 1 day per week in both years. In 2022, the gender breakdown was 58% female/42% male and in 2023, the breakdown was 59% female/41% male.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.The information required by the Deputy is outlined hereunder in tabular form with respect to my Department.

   "The Department is aware of pressures for school places for the 2024/25 school year in Newcastle_Rathcoole School Planning Area.  A critical next step for the Department is to establish the actual number of additional first year places required for 2024 in order for an appropriate solution to be put in place.  In that context, schools in a number of areas of enrolment pressure, including Town, have been requested to share data on applications for admissions.  This data has been received by my officials and is currently being analysed with a view to establishing the actual requirement for places.  Preliminary assessments indicate that duplications of applications, and applications from outside the local area, are very much contributing to enrolment pressures in the town. The Department is working to clarify the actual requirement for additional school places and to identify particular further capacity requirements for 2024 and forthcoming years.  The Department will engage with schools and patrons to put any required solutions in place - beyond those that are already in train - to ensure sufficient school places to meet the needs of students in the area.  The information requested by the Deputy is not available at this time. The availability of places is a matter for each individual school in the context of their Admissions legislation.

   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 648, 654, 655, 658 and 659 together. The tertiary education system plays a central role in ensuring that our graduates from higher education, further education and training and from apprenticeship are equipped with the essential skills, vocational, professional and transversal skills and competencies that will equip them for success in work. These skills enhance their employability and ensure graduates have skills to adapt to diverse tasks and contribute meaningfully to the workplace and the society. With 400,000 people enrolled in learning across further and higher education, the Department is responsible for a sizeable sector. Learning outcomes have a significant influence on people's life paths. Compared to the EU and OECD averages, Ireland has high levels of higher education attainment. The agility and flexibility of the tertiary system is underscored by responsiveness to priority industry and enterprise workforce needs under key policy initiatives that require whole-of-government efforts and collaboration such as, for example; the Action Plan for Apprenticeship; Funding the Future; the Green Skills for FET Roadmap; and the National Digital Strategy Harnessing Digital. Those concerted efforts aim to improve balance between skills demand and supply. In November last year I welcomed the publication of the 2023 National Skills Bulletin which showed that 2.55 million persons were employed in 2022 (annual average), an increase of 158,100 persons (or 6.6%) since 2021 and 9.9% (or 228,500 persons) above 2019 levels. In addition it showed that 119,400 persons were unemployed in 2022 (annual average), a fall of 38,400 persons (or 24.3%) since 2021, and the lowest levels observed since before the 2008 financial crisis. Budget 2024 secured an additional €65.2million in core funding under Funding the Future. This funding when combined with the €40.5million secured in Budget 2023, will increase the core funding provided under Funding the Future to €105.7million.   This additional funding will lead to increased staffing levels and enhanced support services for students. It will also expand the capabilities of our higher education institutions to deliver on priority skills needs and the further development of tertiary programmes. The additional funding secured in the last two budgets is aligned with the intention that over a number of years, further additional core funding will be prioritised through the Estimates process, while taking account of the Government’s budgetary and fiscal stance. While DFHERIS has responsibility for skills policy, this broader skills ecosystem informs and drives responsive, flexible forecasting, planning, and provision. The National Skills Council (NSC) and nine Regional Skills Fora (RSF), created under the National Skills Strategy, foster engagement and collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies, the education and training system, and enterprise. The broader skills ecosystem also encompasses entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU, hosted in SOLAS), the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment) and the National Training Fund Advisory Group (NTFAG, DFHERIS). The role of innovation and research is also key to addressing these challenges. A whole of government approach to the implementation of Ireland’s National Research and Innovation strategy, Impact 2030, is being progressed to ensure the national research and innovation system supports key Government strategies such as the White Paper for Enterprise, the Climate Action Plan and Smart Specialisation of regions. A key focus will be on ensuring and communicating the impact of research and innovation at every level - local, regional, national and international. Research and Innovation have long been recognised as being essential to improving productivity and competitiveness. Pillar Three of Impact 2030 in particular sets out how enterprise led Research & Innovation contributes and engages with the national Research & Innovation system. My Department is also progressing a landmark Research Bill to amalgamate the functions of Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Research Council into a new Research Agency, to maximise the impact of the approximately €300 million of national competitive research funding which is currently being invested in this area; importantly, this represents almost 40% of Government expenditure on Research & Development. The Research and Innovation Bill 2024 completed Dáil Second Stage in January and is scheduled for Committee Stage on 28 February. The Bill will establish a new funding agency Taighde Éireann or Research Ireland with the capacity to address the issues we as a society are facing, in particular with regard to climate change and the digital transition; and to enable us to better engage and compete at an international level, in terms of the opportunities ahead of us. My Department does not currently produce specific projections for the number of higher education graduates. However, under the assumptions of the most recent projections of full-time enrolment in higher education, enrolments are expected to rise a further 13% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase. The underlying assumptions of these projections are decided upon via an expert group and are regularly reviewed. A review of the latest projections of enrolments in higher education is scheduled to begin before year end, with work on updating the projections likely to follow."

  ["Technological Universities have been established to create a step-change in the delivery of higher-level skills, new knowledge creation, venture start-ups and collaborative innovation support for enterprise; and hence to meaningfully expand the higher education sector’s contribution to regional development.   To support the post-establishment development of TUs, the Higher Education Authority and my Department commissioned the OECD to conduct a review of academic career paths, contracts, and organisation design in TUs. I brought this report to Cabinet in December 2022, and it was subsequently published.  The report highlights a range of complex interconnected issues for consideration. These include the academic year basis of contracts, workload defined in terms of instructional hours without systemised recognition of research or engagement, instructional models out of step with international peers, the absence of professorial ranks, and the balance between academic staff and professional, management and support staff.  I am committed to introducing the recommendations of the OECD report, including professorship grades and a revised academic contract in Technological Universities, however it is important that this is done in a considered way, working through the complex range of interconnected issues.  In December, the Taoiseach and I met with the Presidents and Chairs of the technological universities to discuss these priority issues for enabling TUs in their development.  Officials in my Department are continuing to work closely with representatives of the technological universities and other stakeholders in progressing these issues."
   "In recognition of the need to stimulate supply of student accommodation, the Government has supported my Department to develop policy responses to activate delivery of new and additional student accommodation for public higher education institutions. In November 2022, I received Government approval for funding to assist the TUs in developing a student accommodation programme, which will be based on a regional needs and feasibility assessment. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) appointed consultants to undertake the first phase of this work. The objective of the feasibility study is to establish an accurate “as is” account of available student accommodation supply; project future supply and demand for accommodation; and to ascertain what opportunities are available to meet the future demand for student accommodation. Phase one of this study, a supply and demand analysis, is being finalised by the HEA. This Phase involved extensive data-gathering across all TUs, Universities and Colleges, comprising a data collection framework, 1-to-1 meetings with HEI representatives, and a centralised student survey on student accommodation.  In parallel with the data collection, the HEA is overseeing the development of a standardised Preliminary Business Case (PBC) process and templates. The intention of this work is to develop a programmatic approach to facilitate future TU student accommodation proposals. It is proposed that this will be achieved by using the demand analysis from the data collection process to inform a framework of delivery models and funding options as part of the second phase of the study. Phase two of this study is to design and assess a framework for student accommodation for the TU sector and will commence this week with correspondence issuing to the sector outlining the timelines and requirements for this work.  In addition, in the coming weeks a call for student accommodation proposals will be sought from the sector for assessment as part of process.   The Housing Finance Agency Act 1981, as amended, facilitates lending by the HFA to institutions of higher education, including TUs. My Department is working with relevant Government Departments to explore the development of a specific borrowing framework for TUs. The options arising from the TU feasibility study will inform this ongoing engagement. It is anticipated that any borrowing framework would in the first instance prioritise the provision of student accommodation in line with commitments in the Government's Housing for All plan."
   "I’m very pleased to advise the Deputy, that substantial completion of the project at Coonagh will be substantially completed in February 2024, with students due on campus later this year. This represents over €24m in capital funding from my Department.   The Technological University of the Shannon Coonagh, Limerick project was approved for the fit-out of an existing building in Coonagh, Limerick, initially developed for use as a shopping centre, but now being repurposed by TUS for education use. This will facilitate the move of TUS’s Limerick engineering facilities to the new campus.  When complete the Coonagh campus will facilitate an expansion of engineering education and research, with an emphasis on increasing apprenticeship provision. The new engineering campus will facilitate significant growth in student numbers in engineering disciplines. This will create a centre for manufacturing engineering and other engineering activities in the region. It will also improve TUS’s teaching, learning and social learning spaces and allow for new engineering related programmes, particularly the growing apprentice areas.  The development of the engineering campus in Coonagh also frees up space at the Moylish campus to facilitate the development of a new Applied Science and IT building currently under tender as part of the Higher Education PPP Programme Bundle 2."
   "It is anticipated that any borrowing framework for TUs would in the first instance prioritise the provision of student accommodation in line with commitments in the Government's Housing for All plan.  Housing for All contains a number of key actions relating to the development of additional student accommodation supply supported by the State. It also identifies the need to examine financing options and mechanisms for the Technological Sector to provide student accommodation.  The Housing Finance Agency Act 1981, as amended, facilitates lending by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to institutions of higher education. This now includes Technological Universities for the purposes of student accommodation specifically.  The development of a specific TU borrowing framework would require approval from Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department and the HEA are working through a large scale programme of work with the TU sector to develop proposals for student accommodation. This work includes an assessment of a range of funding and delivery mechanisms for student accommodation with the sector. We are also in the process of progressing large teaching and learning capital developments with the sector through exchequer funding supports.  The impacts, risks and responsibilities arising from such funding and delivery mechanisms are key considerations in this context.

   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 642 and 643 together. Expanding the number of places available on Health and Social Care Profession (HSCP) programmes is a priority for my Department. In July 2023, Minister Donnelly and I announced over 400 additional permanent places across HSCP related programmes from September 2023. This included five places on the Radiation Therapy programme in Trinity College Dublin.  There are some issues, which are in the control of the health sector which need to be considered in any proposal to expand places on programmes like Radiation Therapy. These relate to guarantees of clinical placements and qualified practice tutors for students on placements. This requires the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure there are suitable placements and personnel available. There has been extensive engagement between my Department and the Department of Health, and both Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork, regarding the expansion of places on radiation therapy programmes. I met with representatives from Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and University College Cork (UCC) Radiation Therapy programmes, as well as Radiation Therapy Professionals, on 25th October 2023. Both my own officials and officials in the Department of Health have also had further meetings with TCD and UCC on the potential expansion of these programmes.  I understand that some funding has been allocated by the Department of Health to support the development of sustainable practice education broadly for the Health and Social Care Professions in 2024. The National Health and Social Care Professions Office in the HSE is coordinating this process and leading on a number of programmes to support practice education for Health and Social Care Professions which will include identifying essential requirements."],

If you can't find any information in the context to answer\n       the question, then reply with \"I am unable to answer this question with\n       the information I have available.\" \n\n CONTEXT: Technological Universities have been established to create a step-change in the delivery of higher-level skills, new knowledge creation, venture start-ups and collaborative innovation support for enterprise; and hence to meaningfully expand the higher education sector’s contribution to regional development.   To support the post-establishment development of TUs, the Higher Education Authority and my Department commissioned the OECD to conduct a review of academic career paths, contracts, and organisation design in TUs. I brought this report to Cabinet in December 2022, and it was subsequently published.  The report highlights a range of complex interconnected issues for consideration. These include the academic year basis of contracts, workload defined in terms of instructional hours without systemised recognition of research or engagement, instructional models out of step with international peers, the absence of professorial ranks, and the balance between academic staff and professional, management and support staff.  I am committed to introducing the recommendations of the OECD report, including professorship grades and a revised academic contract in Technological Universities, however it is important that this is done in a considered way, working through the complex range of interconnected issues.  In December, the Taoiseach and I met with the Presidents and Chairs of the technological universities to discuss these priority issues for enabling TUs in their development.  Officials in my Department are continuing to work closely with representatives of the technological universities and other stakeholders in progressing these issues.\n\nIn recognition of the need to stimulate supply of student accommodation, the Government has supported my Department to develop policy responses to activate delivery of new and additional student accommodation for public higher education institutions. In November 2022, I received Government approval for funding to assist the TUs in developing a student accommodation programme, which will be based on a regional needs and feasibility assessment. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) appointed consultants to undertake the first phase of this work. The objective of the feasibility study is to establish an accurate “as is” account of available student accommodation supply; project future supply and demand for accommodation; and to ascertain what opportunities are available to meet the future demand for student accommodation. Phase one of this study, a supply and demand analysis, is being finalised by the HEA. This Phase involved extensive data-gathering across all TUs, Universities and Colleges, comprising a data collection framework, 1-to-1 meetings with HEI representatives, and a centralised student survey on student accommodation.  In parallel with the data collection, the HEA is overseeing the development of a standardised Preliminary Business Case (PBC) process and templates. The intention of this work is to develop a programmatic approach to facilitate future TU student accommodation proposals. It is proposed that this will be achieved by using the demand analysis from the data collection process to inform a framework of delivery models and funding options as part of the second phase of the study. Phase two of this study is to design and assess a framework for student accommodation for the TU sector and will commence this week with correspondence issuing to the sector outlining the timelines and requirements for this work.  In addition, in the coming weeks a call for student accommodation proposals will be sought from the sector for assessment as part of process.   The Housing Finance Agency Act 1981, as amended, facilitates lending by the HFA to institutions of higher education, including TUs. My Department is working with relevant Government Departments to explore the development of a specific borrowing framework for TUs. The options arising from the TU feasibility study will inform this ongoing engagement. It is anticipated that any borrowing framework would in the first instance prioritise the provision of student accommodation in line with commitments in the Government's Housing for All plan.\n\nI’m very pleased to advise the Deputy, that substantial completion of the project at Coonagh will be substantially completed in February 2024, with students due on campus later this year. This represents over €24m in capital funding from my Department.   The Technological University of the Shannon Coonagh, Limerick project was approved for the fit-out of an existing building in Coonagh, Limerick, initially developed for use as a shopping centre, but now being repurposed by TUS for education use. This will facilitate the move of TUS’s Limerick engineering facilities to the new campus.  When complete the Coonagh campus will facilitate an expansion of engineering education and research, with an emphasis on increasing apprenticeship provision. The new engineering campus will facilitate significant growth in student numbers in engineering disciplines. This will create a centre for manufacturing engineering and other engineering activities in the region. It will also improve TUS’s teaching, learning and social learning spaces and allow for new engineering related programmes, particularly the growing apprentice areas.  The development of the engineering campus in Coonagh also frees up space at the Moylish campus to facilitate the development of a new Applied Science and IT building currently under tender as part of the Higher Education PPP Programme Bundle 2.\n\nIt is anticipated that any borrowing framework for TUs would in the first instance prioritise the provision of student accommodation in line with commitments in the Government's Housing for All plan.  Housing for All contains a number of key actions relating to the development of additional student accommodation supply supported by the State. It also identifies the need to examine financing options and mechanisms for the Technological Sector to provide student accommodation.  The Housing Finance Agency Act 1981, as amended, facilitates lending by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to institutions of higher education. This now includes Technological Universities for the purposes of student accommodation specifically.  The development of a specific TU borrowing framework would require approval from Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department and the HEA are working through a large scale programme of work with the TU sector to develop proposals for student accommodation. This work includes an assessment of a range of funding and delivery mechanisms for student accommodation with the sector. We are also in the process of progressing large teaching and learning capital developments with the sector through exchequer funding supports.  The impacts, risks and responsibilities arising from such funding and delivery mechanisms are key considerations in this context. Furthermore safeguards will be required to ensure that projects would not adversely impact the resources or financial position of TUs themselves or the wider public finances. Stated requisite oversight, risk evaluation, project management and attendant governance and regulatory processes also needs to be established.  My officials are continuing to work with relevant Government Departments and Agencies through this assessment process for the Technological University (TU) sector, as part of an assessment of a range of mechanisms for the delivery of student accommodation for the TU sector.  Phase two of the TU study has commenced with Universities due to make initial submissions to the HEA by mid March, with an evaluation and output report due from the HEA in mid-April.

  ["My Department has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, which were constructed under the auspices of the ex-Congested Districts Board. Previously Donegal County Council has carried out repair works on pier identified by the Deputy. My Department is not aware of any significant capital works required to maintain this pier. I am however pleased to advise that Donegal County Council was approved for funding of over €27 million under the Brexit Adjustment Local Authority Marine Infrastructure Scheme 2022-2023. The Scheme is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve. This Scheme will help to shape the future of Gweedore and many other coastal communities to address the impacts of Brexit through the delivery of safe, accessible, lasting infrastructure and supports economic diversification right around our coastline."
   "The Strategy for the Inshore Fisheries Sector 2019-2023 was the first industry-led blueprint for the Irish inshore fisheries sector involving the National and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums. I understand an inclusive approach was taken in developing that strategy, and in identifying the key issues and priorities for the sector, including a Steering Group with industry and State partners, a dedicated workshop and public consultation.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), Ireland’s seafood development agency, has led the implementation of this strategy, in partnership with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and with the support of my Department, the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and other agencies. In contributing to the actions set out in the strategy, BIM carried out an Inshore Census during 2023 with the aim of gathering more detailed data on the Irish inshore sector and ensuring that there is a suitable evidence base to inform the current developing strategy for this important part of Ireland’s fishing fleet. BIM have reported a high response rate to this Census and are currently analysing the data provided by inshore fishers to this valuable initiative. I can inform the Deputy that BIM is actively engaging with the inshore sector on a new Strategy and it is envisaged that an extensive consultation process will take place with the sector and other stakeholders. Since the NIFF brought forward the first industry-led Strategy for the sector in 2019, and during the lifetime of this Government, two Producer Organisations have been guided to provide additional representation for inshore fishers to give them a stronger voice. My Department completed the formal recognition process of the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation (IIMRO) as an EU Producer Organisation that focuses on our offshore islands and that of the National Inshore Fishermen’s Association (NIFA) as an EU Producer Organisation for inshore fishers. The new Strategy is being eagerly pursued and was discussed also at a meeting of the NIFF last week with my Department continuing to support this process, along with its future implementation.  The development of the new Strategy will also provide a means of engaging with the sector on its goals and ambitions while seeking to address matters important to this sector and fully considering measures to support its longer-term sustainability and viability. The Strategy will also aim to comprehensively address the challenges faced by the inshore sector and the measures necessary to support it in adapting to these challenges. It is expected that full engagement and consultation in respect of the new Strategy will continue to take place during the first half of the year with the Strategy anticipated to be ready for publication in the later part of 2024."
   "I can assure the Deputy that my Department constantly monitors the needs of the fisheries sector. Along with regularly meeting with representatives of the sector, holding formal consultations and attending public forums, we monitor developments in key economic indicators. My Department prepares and publishes an Annual Review and Outlook (ARO), which provides up-to-date information and statistical analysis from a variety of sources, to give a detailed overview of Ireland’s agri-food sector and an outlook for the future. The most recent Annual Review and Outlook report was published in November 2023. I established the Seafood Sector Taskforce in March 2021 to examine the impacts of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on our fishing sector and coastal communities and to make recommendations to me on a mitigation strategy. I received the Report of the Seafood Task Force in October 2021 and 16 schemes have been developed based on its recommendations. Included in the schemes are short term supports and longer-term restructuring initiatives for the fishing fleet, capital supports for both processing and aquaculture sectors, funding for entrepreneurial initiatives in coastal communities and investment in marine infrastructure. Combined, these schemes contribute to sustaining employment in the seafood sector as a whole, providing new career opportunities and ensuring those transitioning within the sector are supported. In addition to the measures recommended by the Task Force, my Department’s €240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme 2014-20 has been operating since 2016, supporting the sustainable development of our seafood sector. The Programme has now concluded and is succeeded by the new Seafood Development Programme under EMFAF 2021-27 which was adopted by the European Commission in December 2022. The new €258 million programme will continue the provision of a wide range of financial supports to fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises and to enterprises, groups and individuals in coastal communities. These will include supports for capital investment, innovation, professional advisory services and marketing.  In addition, the Department funds Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), which is the state agency responsible for development of the Seafood sector. BIM works closely with industry and all of the recognised representative groups, actively supporting the development of the sector in a myriad of ways. Further information on the work of BIM is available on BIM's website at BIM - Supporting the Irish Seafood Industry BIM will receive funding in excess of €22 million from my Department in 2024 to support its work.  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to addressing the challenges facing our seafood sector and I continue to pursue all opportunities to increase the fishing opportunities for Ireland’s fishing fleet."
   "In the years 2021 to 2023 funding of over €216 million for the seafood sector was provided under the schemes which were put in place following the report of the Seafood Task Force, and funded under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve. Schemes were also in place during that period, funded under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  As such, the implementation of the EMFAF during 2021 - 2023 has focused predominantly on ensuring continued support for the work programmes of the marine agencies (Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority) and Bord Bia. This has been done by means of a process whereby the agencies submit applications to my Department for approval in principle. It is intended to progress the finalisation of implementation plans for all of these work programmes, and their adoption by the EMFAF programme Monitoring Committee, over the coming months. Work is also underway now to finalise implementation plans for schemes, including the Fisheries and Local Action Group Scheme, to support industry, and we expect that the first number of such schemes will be in place in the first quarter of 2024, with further schemes to follow."
   "The Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme 2023 provided assistance to inshore fishers in adjusting their business operations as a result of the impacts of Brexit. The scheme had a budget of some €3.5 million and supported almost 740 beneficiaries at a cost of €2.44 million. The deadline of 31 December 2023 is set out in the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) Regulation . I am informed by BIM that it is no longer possible to determine grant approvals or make further payments under the scheme.

  ["Changes to the employment permits system for workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to address skills shortages in Ireland’s care workers and home carer sector were announced by my Department on 16 December 2022. A quota of 1000 permits was made available for this sector.

Where this occurs, the application is returned together with the fee, and the applicant is advised to submit a new, complete application. It is not possible to give precise figures for the number of applications  returned at pre-check stages. This is because an application is only assigned a SOC (Standard Occupational Classification) code identifier at the processing stage. However, an estimate based on a keyword search of applications returned at pre-check stage up to 12th January 2024 is 93.

   "Since its introduction in June 2018, under the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018 (S.I. No. 230 of 2018), the labour market access permission issued by my Department, has had a very positive impact for international protection applicants and employers alike. Applicants are eligible to apply if: • They are an international protection applicant; and • They have waited at least 5 months from their “Application Received” date for their first instance recommendation; and • They are cooperating with the international protection process – delays in receiving a recommendation must not be attributable to the applicant. Following that, a person will be issued a permission for labour market access if, at 6 months, they have not yet received a first instance recommendation. This permission is valid for 12 months and may be renewed until a final decision is made on the person's international protection application. A significant increase in the number of applications was experienced during 2023, reflecting the increase of overall applications for international protection received since 2022. There has also been an increase in renewal applications.   Currently the processing time for labour market access applications (both first time and renewal) is approximately 145 days and there are approximately 3,000 applications currently outstanding.

  ["Local Improvement Scheme 2024 Roads Outstanding "
   "In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, each local authority has statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of their regional and local roads. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.  Arising from the arrangements in place in relation to Local Property Tax receipts, the four Dublin Councils are largely self-funding for works on regional and local roads since 2015 and my Department no longer provides grants to these Councils under the main regional and local road grant categories. Within the budget available to the Department, grant funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility with additional weighting based on contributing traffic factors in specific areas. The length of regional and local roads within each local authority that have been used as a basis for maintenance grant allocations with effect from 2020 are set out in the table below. "
   "Local authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock and the management of their estates, which includes facilitating tenants’ participation in estate management. "
   "The Local Government Act 2001 provides the statutory basis for the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS). Under that scheme, funding can be provided to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads (that is roads not taken in charge by local authorities) which meet the criteria set out in the Act. It is important to highlight that the maintenance of non-public roads is the responsibility of the relevant landowners; local authorities only have statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of public roads (in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993). Works on these public roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road Grants.  In 2018, the Department introduced ring-fenced funding for Community Involvement Schemes. The purpose of the Community Involvement Scheme is to facilitate local community participation in the repair of local roads. The focus of the programme is on the repair of more lightly trafficked public roads which might not be high on the list of a local authority's annual roadwork programme. Under the scheme a local community can contribute in money or in kind, for example by making labour or machinery available.    While community contributions in the range 15% to 30% had been required up to 2021, depending on the mix between works and monies, the contribution rate has now been reduced to a minimum of 10% for monetary contributions and 20% for works contribution. This is more in line with Local Improvement Scheme contribution rates. The Community Involvement Scheme is purely voluntary and does not take away from the statutory responsibilities of each road authority. It is intended to be an extra option, where suitable, for local authorities and communities to address issues on tertiary roads where needed."
   "In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, each local authority has statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of their regional and local road network. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority. The primary focus for capital investment under the National Development Plan continues to be the protection and renewal of the regional and local road network which plays a critical role in supporting economic and community links throughout the country. For this reason, approximately 90% of the €658 million of State funding being provided in 2024 is aimed at protection and renewal works. This allocation represents a €32 million increase in State funding compared to the 2023 allocation, with each local authority receiving an increase in funding for their Restoration Improvement Grant. In addition, funding for road safety improvement scheme grants also increased in 2024 compared to 2023, up nearly €300,000.  In addition to protecting and renewing the regional and local road network, it is a priority to carry out targeted improvements to sections of the network and €677 million is earmarked in the NDP for such improvements on new regional and local roads over the 10 year period until 2030. Road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding will be assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines (IG) (formerly known as the Public Spending Code (PSC)) and my Department’s Transport Appraisal Framework (TAF)."],

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.  Arising from the arrangements in place in relation to Local Property Tax receipts, the four Dublin Councils are largely self-funding for works on regional and local roads since 2015 and my Department no longer provides grants to these Councils under the main regional and local road grant categories. Within the budget available to the Department, grant funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility with additional weighting based on contributing traffic factors in specific areas. The length of regional and local roads within each local authority that have been used as a basis for maintenance grant allocations with effect from 2020 are set out in the table below. \n\nLocal authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock and the management of their estates, which includes facilitating tenants’ participation in estate management. \n\nThe Local Government Act 2001 provides the statutory basis for the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS). Under that scheme, funding can be provided to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads (that is roads not taken in charge by local authorities) which meet the criteria set out in the Act. It is important to highlight that the maintenance of non-public roads is the responsibility of the relevant landowners; local authorities only have statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of public roads (in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993). Works on these public roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road Grants.  In 2018, the Department introduced ring-fenced funding for Community Involvement Schemes. The purpose of the Community Involvement Scheme is to facilitate local community participation in the repair of local roads. The focus of the programme is on the repair of more lightly trafficked public roads which might not be high on the list of a local authority's annual roadwork programme. Under the scheme a local community can contribute in money or in kind, for example by making labour or machinery available.    While community contributions in the range 15% to 30% had been required up to 2021, depending on the mix between works and monies, the contribution rate has now been reduced to a minimum of 10% for monetary contributions and 20% for works contribution. This is more in line with Local Improvement Scheme contribution rates. The Community Involvement Scheme is purely voluntary and does not take away from the statutory responsibilities of each road authority. It is intended to be an extra option, where suitable, for local authorities and communities to address issues on tertiary roads where needed.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, each local authority has statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of their regional and local road network. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.

  ["I propose to take Questions Nos. 630, 631, 632 and 633 together.The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the current school year over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million.  Children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language.  There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year. Bus Éireann is responsible for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes on behalf of the Department.  Safety of children travelling on the school transport services is of paramount importance to the Department and to Bus Éireann.  Bus Éireann endeavours, within available resources, to ensure that each eligible child has a reasonable level of school transport service in the context of the Scheme nationally. Routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 3.2 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point. Children are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.  There is an onus of responsibility on parents/guardians to arrange to bring their children to and from the pickup point of a school bus service, taking whatever safety precautions they consider sufficient to ensure their safety. A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. At present, it is not possible for Bus Éireann to examine data on ticket usage as tickets are paper based. However, Bus Éireann undertook a pilot E-Ticketing project.  Based on the information derived from this pilot project, it is intended to review the data and prioritise working towards E-Ticketing on all school transport scheme services .  This will provide the Department and Bus Éireann with greater data on real time travel patterns. Bus Éireann organises for vehicles to be full to capacity with tickets based on applications received and based on the seating capacity of the vehicle.  For safety reasons, it is not possible to issue additional tickets over and above the seating capacity of the vehicle which could result in a potential overload situation arising and all pupils not being carried on the service. It is recognised that all pupils issued with tickets will not travel every morning and every evening.  In addition, certain after school activities may also result in pupils not travelling on certain days. If a family decide that they no longer require their bus tickets for the current school year, they should return these tickets to their local Bus Éireann school transport office and their seats will be reallocated to other pupils wishing to avail of school transport."

The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness, and sustainability and to ensure it services students and their families efficiently and effectively. Considering how to best maximise the benefits now and into the future has been a significant factor in the ongoing review of the Scheme which commenced in February 2021.One of the issues examined as part of the review is how the scheme can support active travel initiatives such as walking and cycling and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme.  The Steering Group has recently completed its work on the final report of the review. This final report includes recommendations on the future operation and strategic development of the scheme and these and the phasing of future implementation of the recommendations is currently under consideration by me and my officials.I am aware that this review is much-awaited, it is recognised that there are improvements which need to be made to the scheme and I know the importance of doing so.

Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus Éireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process. Bus Éireann, who operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, review all school transport services over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.  A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. For school bus operating purposes a “distinct locality” is a cluster of eligible children who reside in the same general area, in the same general direction from the education centre attended, as determined by Bus Éireann taking cognisance of the local road network. Details of the application process for the 2024/2025 school year will be available shortly.  Families can make an on-line application to their school of attendance for the 2024/25 School year on the Bus Éireann portal at www.buseireann.ie/schooltransport."

The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02m.  There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year. Under the current terms of the scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. Any children who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus Éireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process. Bus Éireann, who operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, review all school transport services over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.  A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. For school bus operating purposes a “distinct locality” is a cluster of eligible children who reside in the same general area, in the same general direction from the education centre attended, as determined by Bus Éireann taking cognisance of the local road network. Details of the application process for the 2024/2025 school year will be available shortly.  Families can make an on-line application to their school of attendance for the 2024/25 School year on the Bus Éireann portal at www.buseireann.ie/schooltransport.\n\nThe School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02m. The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO). School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO. Bus Éireann is responsible for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes on behalf of my Department. Bus Éireann endeavours, within available resources, to ensure that each eligible child has a reasonable level of school transport service in the context of the Scheme nationally. Care is taken to minimise the amount of travel for students, I am aware that it is not always possible to secure a suitable placement in a local school and children and occasionally, the specialist nature of the placement involved requires the child to travel some distance.  If families have any particular queries they can contact School Transport Section directly at school_transport@education.gov.ie where officials in the Department will be happy to assist.",

At post-primary level, a kitchenette is provided off the General Purpose/Dining Area. The kitchenette may be used to prepare light refreshments and should be equipped with a cooker, a water boiler, a fridge, a dishwasher, worktop and a suitable sink.

   "Since 2020, my Department has invested in the region of €3.5 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of over 690 school building projects with construction currently underway at approximately 300 other projects.  School building projects at construction involve an overall State investment of over €1.2 billion.  We also have over 200 modular accommodation projects that are very well advanced for delivery or at construction stage. This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities. The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector are as follows: \tdemographic change, including keeping pace with delivery of SEN and accommodation for Ukrainian pupils particularly at Post Primary level; \talignment with housing provision and national planning at school planning area level; and  \tclimate action objectives including deep energy retrofit. Key priorities for my Department are supporting the operation of the school system and adding necessary capacity to cater for special education needs provision, mainstream demographics and catering for students from Ukraine and other countries under the International Protection system. The current status of all projects, including those in Dublin, are listed on a county by county basis at www.gov.ie/en/service/c5b56b-major-projects/ and is updated on a regular basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction."
   "I wish to confirm that the decision making authority for any change of status is the patron/trustees of the school(s), subject to the approval of my Department. To date my Department has not received any application from the patron for a change of status for the school referred to by the Deputy. My Department understands that there has been discussions on this matter locally and that it has been confirmed by the patron that there will be no change in status for the school for 2024/25. This communication outlined the patron's reasons for this decision. When or if an application is received in my Department on this matter from the patron it will be considered and a decision confirmed to the patron as soon as possible."
   "The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a school-based psychological service to all recognised primary and post-primary schools nationally through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, and the academic, social and emotional development of all learners. The NEPS service provides access for all schools to:• Psychological support in the event of a Critical Incident• A Casework Service for individual children where there is a need for intensive consultation and assessment • A school staff Support and Development Service, to build school capability to provide a comprehensive continuum of support in schools and• Ongoing access to advice and support for schools. In the event that a student has a need for more targeted counselling or a specialised intervention, a referral is made to an outside agency. The NEPS psychologist can identify the most appropriate referral pathway and supports school with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  Dublin 1 is part of the NEPS Dublin region. All primary and post primary schools in the Dublin region have access to the NEPS service outlined above.  In addition to the NEPS service, as part of the North East Inner City (NEIC) City-Connects project, 10 primary schools have access to an enhanced NEPS service as part of the NEIC Multi-Disciplinary Team (NEIC MDT), which is an interagency team with NEPS and the HSE working directly in these schools. These schools have additional time with their NEPS psychologist."
   "Under the model for allocating additional teaching resources to support children and young people, with special educational needs, in our schools, the Department provides supports directly to schools, allowing schools greater autonomy in the flexible allocation of teaching resources, based on the needs of children and young people. Schools can respond to individual needs in a flexible way, and children do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching support. This means that those with the highest level of need can access the highest level of support, within the school, in a timely manner.  My Department’s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary and special schools. The NEPS service provides access for all schools to:• Psychological support in the event of a Critical Incident• A Casework Service for individual children where there is a need for intensive consultation and assessment via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).• A school staff Support and Development Service, to build school capability to provide a comprehensive continuum of support in schools • Ongoing access to advice and support for schools. The focus of the service is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Where reasonable progress is not made, following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist may become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  Where a parent/guardian has a concern about their child’s progress in school, they should request a meeting with the Principal to discuss the child's needs and the supports the school have put in place, and if appropriate to consider a consultation with a NEPS psychologist. In relation to the pupil to which the Deputy refers, no request for the involvement of a NEPS psychologist has been received from the school which this pupil attends."],

Passport Online was rolled out to an additional 175 countries for first time applicants in 2023, meaning that 99.9% of all first-time and renewal applicants worldwide can apply online. Online enhancements rolled out last year have also simplified the process for first time applicants and especially children applying for their first passport. In 2023, the Passport Service was ranked 18th out of 150 public-facing organisations in a survey conducted by the Customer Experience (CX) group. This ranking recognised the Passport Service as the best customer service brand in the public sector. In addition, the Customer Service Hub in the Passport Service was shortlisted for the “Best Customer Service Team” award at the 2023 Customer Experience Awards. 2024 is expected to be another busy year for the Passport Service.

   "A request for additional information was requested from the Deputy. This will be forwarded directly once it is received."
   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive together. The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02m. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year The School Transport Scheme is an important service for families and children. The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the current scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. In addition, temporary alleviation measures have been continued for the 2023/2024 school year, and mean that transport is provided where there is capacity to do so, for post-primary concessionary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied and paid on time.  Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. A review of the School Transport Scheme has been completed. This review was conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness, and sustainability and to ensure it services students and their families adequately. The School Transport Scheme 2030 report has now been published, which marks the largest review of the School Transport Scheme since it was established in 1967. The Government is committed to working to achieve the report’s recommendation of expanding access to the scheme so that an additional 100,000 pupils can be carried by 2030. Throughout the review, the value of the School Transport Scheme to both families and in supporting wider Government policies has been very apparent. In summary, school transport not only plays an important part in supporting children's access to education, but it also aligns to wider Government objectives.  Overall, the recommended changes to the future operation of the Scheme concern:• expansion of the current eligibility criteria,• addressing current operational challenges• charges and grants and• over time, moving towards better integration with public transport to ensure optimum value for money to the Exchequer With regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, firstly with regard to the cost of incorporating electric vehicles and other low emission vehicles into the school transport fleet, moves to lower emission fleet will be implemented in line with the Government’s targets as set out in the Climate Action Plan. The cost of moving to lower emission fleet will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the time. It is worth bearing in mind that circa 94% of the total school transport fleet is operated by private contractors under contract to Bus Éireann. With regard to the estimated cost to Climate Action targets and other Government policies as considered in the review, an element of the costs to meet these is included in the total estimated cost to operate the scheme in future years. The estimated cost to operate the scheme out to 2030 is set out in the table below.    It must be noted that there are certain assumptions and projections used in compiling these costs.  Finally with regard collaborations between my Department and Connecting Ireland, a phased implementation of the review’s recommendations will commence in September 2024. This will include a shared effort between my Department and the Department of Transport to pilot and introduce greater integration of the roll out of transport networks with school transport routes, with a view to expanding provision of transport and reducing the reliance over time on individual car trips for school journeys. This plan will be reviewed at the end of 2024 at which point further decisions will be made about future integration potential, including any further pilot projects.  It is intended subject to resources to commence implementing the revised eligibility criteria in the 2025/2026 school year."],

In that regard there are more than 3,700 individual employers (boards of management of primary schools and post primary schools, as well as ETBs). While my Department does not collect data on the recruitment by individual employers, an analysis of the Department’s payroll system is being undertaken to generate statistics on the teacher workforce across the country for the 2023-2024 school year and will use this for reporting on workforce statistics going forward. This will include statistics on the Full Time Equivalents (FTE), permanent and fixed contracts, with breakdowns possible by County.  This work began recently and is ongoing, the relevant data for 2023-2024 is expected to be available in the near future.  Statistical information on the headcount of teachers is already produced in a similar way, and is available on My Departments website www.gov.ie/en/publication/c97fbd-teacher-statistics/. These statistics are extracted from the mentioned payroll databases using a single extract (30th June) each year and includes contracted and casual teachers.

This will be forwarded directly once it is received.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive together. The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education. In the current school year over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02m. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year The School Transport Scheme is an important service for families and children. The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the current scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. In addition, temporary alleviation measures have been continued for the 2023/2024 school year, and mean that transport is provided where there is capacity to do so, for post-primary concessionary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied and paid on time.  Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. A review of the School Transport Scheme has been completed. This review was conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness, and sustainability and to ensure it services students and their families adequately. The School Transport Scheme 2030 report has now been published, which marks the largest review of the School Transport Scheme since it was established in 1967. The Government is committed to working to achieve the report’s recommendation of expanding access to the scheme so that an additional 100,000 pupils can be carried by 2030. Throughout the review, the value of the School Transport Scheme to both families and in supporting wider Government policies has been very apparent. In summary, school transport not only plays an important part in supporting children's access to education, but it also aligns to wider Government objectives.  Overall, the recommended changes to the future operation of the Scheme concern:• expansion of the current eligibility criteria,• addressing current operational challenges• charges and grants and• over time, moving towards better integration with public transport to ensure optimum value for money to the Exchequer With regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, firstly with regard to the cost of incorporating electric vehicles and other low emission vehicles into the school transport fleet, moves to lower emission fleet will be implemented in line with the Government’s targets as set out in the Climate Action Plan. The cost of moving to lower emission fleet will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the time. It is worth bearing in mind that circa 94% of the total school transport fleet is operated by private contractors under contract to Bus Éireann. With regard to the estimated cost to Climate Action targets and other Government policies as considered in the review, an element of the costs to meet these is included in the total estimated cost to operate the scheme in future years. The estimated cost to operate the scheme out to 2030 is set out in the table below.    It must be noted that there are certain assumptions and projections used in compiling these costs.  Finally with regard collaborations between my Department and Connecting Ireland, a phased implementation of the review’s recommendations will commence in September 2024. This will include a shared effort between my Department and the Department of Transport to pilot and introduce greater integration of the roll out of transport networks with school transport routes, with a view to expanding provision of transport and reducing the reliance over time on individual car trips for school journeys. This plan will be reviewed at the end of 2024 at which point further decisions will be made about future integration potential, including any further pilot projects.  It is intended subject to resources to commence implementing the revised eligibility criteria in the 2025/2026 school year.",

  ["Addressing female participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the National Sports Policy and a core priority for myself and Minister Catherine Martin. That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of National Governing Bodies (NGBs).  The Sports Action Plan set a target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023. It is a priority to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation. The average percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24%, in 2019, to 43%. In relation to the overall percentage of women on boards in the Irish sports sector, this now stands at 44%.  Those NGBs who have not obtained the target of 40% females on their boards will only be permitted to draw down 50% of their funding allocation from Sport Ireland this year, until such time as they reach the 40% target. Sport Ireland will continue to provide support to NGBs towards achieving the target of 40% and will continue to monitor and report on progress."
   "The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 bringing the total allocations in that time to over €1.15 billion. The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.  The latest round of the SCEP (2023) closed for applications on Friday 8 September. A preliminary examination of the submitted applications demonstrates that the Programme has again generated a very large number of applications, including one from the organisation to which the Deputy refers, and it is evident that the total number will exceed the previous record of 3,106 applications submitted under the last (2020) round.  The \"Scoring Assessment and Assessment Manual\" for the 2023 round has been finalised and I hope to have this published shortly. Simultaneously, I also plan to publish the full list of all applications received by county including the relevant sport type for each application received.

In this regard, it is planned to assess the \"equipment-only\" applications first and announce these grants in the coming months. Work will then commence on assessing the capital applications with the allocations likely to be announced later in 2024."

   "The National Sports Policy, which was published in 2018, provided for a new Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The aim of the fund is to provide Exchequer support for larger sports projects and facilities where the required Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount available under the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme. During 2020, allocations of €86.4 million in LSSIF funding were awarded to 33 different proposals. Last December, in response to project delivery delays experienced by grantees arising from the pandemic and construction inflation, Minister Martin and I announced additional funding of €37.6 million for 27 of those LSSIF projects. The criteria for the first scheme, plus allocations, payments and other background information can be found online on my Department's website. It is important to emphasise that the LSSIF is a relatively new scheme with only one call for proposals to date. The first LSSIF allocations were announced just prior to the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic obviously gave rise to significant financial challenges for all grantees with many of them having to reprioritise their own expenditure plans due to reductions in their income streams. In more recent times, the high level of construction inflation has also presented considerable challenges for grantees. In view of these issues, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants and meetings with all grantees have taken place. The Review is expected to be finalised soon and any issues identified will be addressed as part of the terms and conditions of the next LSSIF call. Minister Martin and I have also confirmed that a new round of the LSSIF will open for applications in the first half of 2024, with the dates, terms and conditions to be confirmed in due course. While the LSSIF programme is aimed primarily at the National Governing Bodies of Sport and local authorities it was also open to other bodies, philanthropic funders, clubs and voluntary organisations to apply. However, such applications would necessarily have to be made and prioritised by a local authority and/or a Governing Body. A fundamental aim of the Government’s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls. It will also be a requirement for all successful LSSIF applicants to publish their Similar Access Policy, in respect of men and women having access to the facilities on similar terms in order for LSSIF funding to be drawn down. From the government’s perspective, if we are to achieve our ambitious targets and get as many people participating in sport as possible we need the necessary facilities. In recent months, I was delighted to see a number of LSSIF projects open to the public, including the Linear Walkway Project in Meath, Phase 1 of Walsh Park in Waterford, and the Regional Athletics Hub in Limerick. By investing in sport facilities across the country, we can best nurture our future sporting talents and reap the benefits of sport and physical activity when it comes to our health and well-being. Finally, over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 bringing the total allocations in that time to over €1.15 billion. I am determined to see continued investment in sports facilities across the country in order to ensure we achieve our ambitious targets for sports participation."

  ["I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 to 76, inclusive, and 87 to 90, inclusive, together.The regeneration of Oliver Bond House sits within the parameters of the National Regeneration Programme which targets the country’s most disadvantaged communities; those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour in accordance with Housing Circular N11/2007 Policy Framework for Regeneration of Local Authority Estates.  It is the responsibility of Local Authorities to identify opportunities to advance Regeneration Programmes in line with this Circular within their respective administrative areas. The aim for regeneration projects is to create sustainable communities through a combination of social, educational and economic initiatives and also by rejuvenating the built environment by a mixture of demolition, construction and refurbishment of dwellings. Although my Department funds Local Authorities for much of this investment, Local Authorities, in developing their regeneration programmes, are required to adopt a holistic and strategic approach involving multiple local and national agencies in an integrated scheme that is designed to create sustainable communities and to address the underlying causes of deprivation in the area. Dublin City Council works closely with the Oliver Bond Regeneration Forum in ensuring the progression of the phased regeneration of the complex. The forum members include residents of Oliver Bond House, DCC officials, representatives from the Gardaí, a representative from Túsla, Robert Emmet CDP, Local Councillors, a full time community development work and it is led by an independent Chairperson. The regeneration of the Oliver Bond House complex by Dublin City Council (DCC) has my Departments full support. My Department provided Stage 1 Capital Appraisal approval to DCC for the redevelopment for the flats in Blocks L, M and N, on the 16th March 2022. This allowed for a guarantee of Departmental support whilst also tasking DCC to investigate a review of options to find the most suitable solution for the site. My Department provided funding approval for four regeneration projects at Oliver Bond House in November 2023. These projects are as follows:• N29-2-988 Social Housing Delivery• N29-2-1057 Oliver Bond Community Centre• N29-2-1058 Oliver Bond Precinct Improvement Works• N29-2-1059 Oliver Bond Social Integration These approvals allow for both the provision of a community centre and the appointment of a Community Development Worker. The provision of a community centre will not only complement the upcoming physical regeneration of the complex and provide much-needed quality housing but also create a thriving community hub that will enhance the quality of life for all residents as well as protecting the investment in physical infrastructure. The location of the Community Centre is a matter for DCC in consultation with local community groups and the approval from my Department allows for this to be developed in a location that best meets the needs of the local community.  DCC have advised that the location of the community centre is currently under discussion between DCC Housing, DCC area office and the Regeneration Forum and it has to be viewed in terms of what is in the long term benefits for the residents of Oliver Bond House.  With regard to the funding for a Community Development Worker, my Department has committed to providing funding for 4 years initially and it is open to the LA to seek further funding if deemed necessarily. The above approvals also allow for improvements to the complex including landscape works, installation of bollards, general precinct improvement works and community consultation costs.  DCC have advised that they have recently received a proposal for a housing officer function and the Council area office is currently liaising with local organisations to understand further the remit and function of this proposed role. For Public Works contracts such as redevelopment it is a matter for DCC to bring forward proposals for Capital Works Management Framework Stage approvals from my Department. The stage applied for by the Council is dependent on the progress of the redevelopment involved. Stage 1 Capital Appraisal is applied for based on feasibility studies and order of magnitude costs of what the proposed regeneration project will provide and estimated costs. Achieving Stage 1 Capital Appraisal approval is a significant milestone in a project and gives the Council approval to appoint a design team to bring the design development to planning lodgement stage. At Stage 2 submission, significant work will have been completed to examine the existing structures and redesign the new homes in preparation of a full planning application.  Dublin City Council appointed an architect from the Council’s City Architects division to lead a design team on the regeneration of Oliver Bond House. The Council are currently in the process of procuring a multi-disciplinary design team, due to be completed by March 2024. The initial concept design has been completed. Once fully appointed, the design team will commence the scheme design and progress the design to planning stage. This is expected to be completed in Q2 2025 and progressed to planning in Q3 2025. Once planning approval is secured, the design team will progress the design and prepare all tender documents to commence procurement of a construction contractor in Q2 2026. It expected that the construction of phase 1 will commence on site in Q4 2026 and be completed in early 2029.  The management and maintenance of DCC’s housing stock is strictly a matter for the Local Authority. DCC have advised that the Council has been undertaking works to improve the living conditions of the residents as well as the structure of the complex. On an ongoing basis there are four caretakers assigned to the complex. Their duties include maintaining common areas, presenting waste for collection and reporting any repairs and accidents in the complex. These caretakers are assigned to the Oliver Bond complex on a full time basis. All maintenance repair requests are responded to in accordance with Housing Maintenance procedures.  They have surveyed all of the units for mechanical ventilation and installed vents in 308 units. 49 tenants refused to have mechanical ventilation installed. Of the remaining 34, DCC are currently working to gain access to install ventilation  DCC have informed my Department that their maintenance staff are currently examining the condition of windows in the units for the purpose of upgrading all single glazed windows to double glazed. 12 blocks have completed surveys and the tender process will start as soon as the remaining surveys are complete. These improvement measures will be implemented in collaboration with the residents.  DCC have also informed my Department that they are actively engaged with the residents on an individual level to address issues brought to their attention. Officers from the City Council engage through the Robert Emmet CDP and attend meetings with resident groups to hear their concerns and shared information on planned and proposed work.  In the longer term, DCC is fully committed to making a positive intervention in all the 391 apartments and will continue to pursue this via its application for grant funding and its collaboration with local residents, elected members and my Department."

It is the responsibility of Local Authorities to identify opportunities to advance Regeneration Programmes in line with this Circular within their respective administrative areas. The aim for regeneration projects is to create sustainable communities through a combination of social, educational and economic initiatives and also by rejuvenating the built environment by a mixture of demolition, construction and refurbishment of dwellings. Although my Department funds Local Authorities for much of this investment, Local Authorities, in developing their regeneration programmes, are required to adopt a holistic and strategic approach involving multiple local and national agencies in an integrated scheme that is designed to create sustainable communities and to address the underlying causes of deprivation in the area. Dublin City Council works closely with the Oliver Bond Regeneration Forum in ensuring the progression of the phased regeneration of the complex. The forum members include residents of Oliver Bond House, DCC officials, representatives from the Gardaí, a representative from Túsla, Robert Emmet CDP, Local Councillors, a full time community development work and it is led by an independent Chairperson. The regeneration of the Oliver Bond House complex by Dublin City Council (DCC) has my Departments full support. My Department provided Stage 1 Capital Appraisal approval to DCC for the redevelopment for the flats in Blocks L, M and N, on the 16th March 2022. This allowed for a guarantee of Departmental support whilst also tasking DCC to investigate a review of options to find the most suitable solution for the site. My Department provided funding approval for four regeneration projects at Oliver Bond House in November 2023. These projects are as follows:• N29-2-988 Social Housing Delivery• N29-2-1057 Oliver Bond Community Centre• N29-2-1058 Oliver Bond Precinct Improvement Works• N29-2-1059 Oliver Bond Social Integration These approvals allow for both the provision of a community centre and the appointment of a Community Development Worker. The provision of a community centre will not only complement the upcoming physical regeneration of the complex and provide much-needed quality housing but also create a thriving community hub that will enhance the quality of life for all residents as well as protecting the investment in physical infrastructure. The location of the Community Centre is a matter for DCC in consultation with local community groups and the approval from my Department allows for this to be developed in a location that best meets the needs of the local community.  DCC have advised that the location of the community centre is currently under discussion between DCC Housing, DCC area office and the Regeneration Forum and it has to be viewed in terms of what is in the long term benefits for the residents of Oliver Bond House.

  ["I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 302 together.Combatting all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) is a priority for me and my Department and this is reflected in a range of policies and legislation, as well as unprecedented increases in Budget allocations. The Government is committed to doubling the number of refuge places to 280 as part of our Zero Tolerance Strategy to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. To achieve this ambitious goal we are working with all stakeholders to put in place the necessary structures and supports to accelerate the delivery of additional refuge accommodation year on year. A key priority was the delivery of the new statutory DSGBV agency, Cuan, which was established on 1 January 2024. In addition, I secured a €10m increase in funding for DSGBV under Budget 2024 and as such, Cuan has a total budget of approximately €59 million for this year. The majority of this funding will be allocated to the provision of DSGBV services. As the Deputy may be aware, the development of 36 refuge units is currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan. The aim is to deliver 98 refuge units in priority locations by end 2025 along with further additional and upgraded units by the end of the Strategy. In addition, Safe Homes - another form of emergency domestic violence accommodation - are an important part of the response. Safe Homes are usually provided as a separate unit of accommodation, for example a flat or a house, at a community or local level. It generally suits those at low to medium risk of serious harm. At the end of 2023, there were 49 Safe Homes available and we are anticipating an additional 12 Safe Homes in 2024. Cuan is working with the sector and the Department of Housing on the provision of refuge and safe homes.  Cuan will be in a position to work closely with relevant Departments, agencies, local authorities and stakeholders to further assess the national need, and build capability and standards with a view to ramping up delivery."
   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 509, 510 and 511 together.Ireland is currently accommodating more than 100,000 people between those fleeing Ukraine and International Protection (IP) applicants. This includes almost 75,000 Ukrainian people who have sought accommodation from the State and over 26,000 IP applicants currently in International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) accommodation. Department officials are working tirelessly to bring more bed spaces into use, and since January 2022 have brought 208 properties into use to accommodate those who arrive in Ireland seeking international protection (IP). This brings the total number of IPAS centres to 257, with capacity for 27,275 beds. Initial offers of accommodation are received by the International Protection Procurement Service (IPPS) primarily through its e-mail portal - ipps@equality.gov.ie. Once an offer is received, IPPS sends a proposal template to the prospective provider that they are required to complete and return. The proposal template seeks to gather as much information as is reasonably practicable to facilitate an objective assessment of the suitability of the premises to accommodate international protection (IP) applicants. This includes information on the building's safety and fitness for occupancy, its catering provision and room sizes, its recreational and lounge facilities and various other criteria such as Wi-Fi, security provision and staffing. When an offer is received and assessed, the onus is on the provider to ensure that the property is of a suitable standard. Similarly, once an offer is received on the online offers portal for Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs) accommodation it is assessed for suitability to accommodate BOTPs. This includes a range of factors such as accommodation suitability, rates, room sizes, capacity and amenities, information on the building's safety and fitness for occupancy, and Wi-Fi, security provision and staffing.  When an offer is received and assessed, the onus is on the provider to ensure that the property is of an adequate standard and that the provider will provide the services in accordance with good industry practice and comply with all applicable laws including but not limited to all obligations in the field of health and safety, environmental, social, child protection, and labour law that apply at the place where the services are provided.  If a property is in need of significant conversion/refurbishment works it is passed on to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for assessment under the Emergency Refurbishment (Ukraine) Programme. As with all offers of accommodation to house BOTPs, but most particularly with regard to those requiring conversion/refurbishment, a detailed assessment must be carried out to ensure the property being offered is being prepared to the required standard and complies with building and fire regulations. This accommodation strand is focused on supporting the delivery of multi-unit refurbished accommodation which requires upgrade and refurbishment before it could accept BOTP residents. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recently launched (November 2023) an online portal for developer-led modular accommodation on gov.ie where providers can submit expressions of interest. All offers made through the portal are given due consideration, and this process is ongoing."

   "My Department’s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual local authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis. My Department publishes a detailed quarterly performance report on homelessness, based on data provided by regional lead local authorities.

   "The expenditure by my Department in relation to Domestic Violence Refuges is for the capital development costs of new refuges.  Operational expenditure in relation to refuges and related services is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.    My Department provides funding to local authorities under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) towards the development of Domestic Violence Refuges and other facilities such as ‘safe houses’.  The local authorities, in turn, support the local organisations bringing forward the Refuge developments. The expenditure in this area in the years requested was €316,345 in 2021, €290,114 in 2022 and €4,353,667 in 2023.The sharp increase in expenditure from 2023 reflects the increased priority set out for this area following from the Government’s launch of ‘Zero Tolerance: The 3rd  National Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy’.  It has set ambitious targets for additional refuge accommodation, aiming to double the number of spaces nationally over the lifetime of the strategy.  Currently there are fifteen priority areas nationally in which Domestic Violence Refuges are in various stages of development, ranging from the Wexford Women’s Refuge which will be completed this summer, to early stage engagements with Domestic Violence service providers and local authorities in other priority areas. The final expenditure in 2024 will depend on the level of advancement achieved by year end across the fifteen priority locations.  Domestic Violence Groups are working with local authorities across these areas on site identification and acquisition, design, planning, procurement and commencing construction on site or, in the case of Wexford, completion on site and opening of the new facility.

As Minister, I have no role in such matters. The Government is, however, committed to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs to deliver a modern, fit-for-purpose policing service. Budget 2024 provides funding of over €2.35 billion for An Garda Síochána.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Air Support Unit (GASU) is a national resource based at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Co. Dublin. The unit is under the direction and control of Assistant Commissioner, Organised and Serious Crime, and the operational control of Detective Chief Superintendent, Operational Support Services. The unit provides a 24-hour proactive and reactive service in support of operational Gardaí on the ground and specialist units. I am advised that the capability of the current Garda aircraft fleet is constantly being evaluated. I am further advised that there are currently two helicopters attached to the GASU, a Eurocopter EC 135 T2 and a EC135 T2+ which were delivered in 2001 and 2007 respectively. I am informed that an application was made to replace these aircraft, and government agreed to the purchase of a fixed wing plane and a helicopter.

As Minister, I have no role in such matters. I can, however, assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to building stronger, safer communities and a strengthened, well-resourced Garda Síochána is central to this policy. This commitment is demonstrated by the unprecedented provision of more than €2.3 billion to the Garda Vote this year, which is allowing for sustained and ongoing recruitment and investment in new equipment and new vehicles.  In addition to new recruits, the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will support the redeployment of Gardaí from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country. The new model will see larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing. I am advised by the Garda authorities that as of 29 February 2024, the latest date for when figures are available, there was a total of 13,930 Garda members nationwide. This represents an increase of almost 9% since the end of December 2015. In addition, the civilianisation programme has freed up almost 900 Garda members from back office work for front line policing work since 2015.Information in relation to the allocation of Gardaí by Division and Station can be found at the following link:"],

As Minister, I have no role in such matters. I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Air Support Unit is a national resource based at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Co. Dublin. The unit is under the direction and control of Assistant Commissioner, Organised and Serious Crime and the operational control of Detective Chief Superintendent, Operational Support Services. The unit provides a 24-hour proactive and reactive service in support of operational Gardaí on the ground and specialist units. Details of the Garda Air Support Unit operational provisions are published annually in An Garda Síochána annual reports available at the following link:  garda.ie/en/information-centre/annual-reports/ I am advised that the 2023 Annual Report is not yet finalised and will be published later this year. As a result, figures for 2023 are unavailable at present. To be of assistance to the Deputy, the below table extracted from the published Annual Reports, outlines the number of incidents the Garda Air Support Unit attended in the years 2021 and 2022. \n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 237 to 239, inclusive, together. The premises referred to is State owned and is part of the Office of Public Works’ property portfolio. It was previously used by the Department of Social Protection for the provision of Intreo services. The Department has informed the Office of Public Works (OPW) that it is now providing Intreo Centre services for the Dublin 1, 3 and 7 areas in the Parnell Street Intreo Centre, Dublin 1. While the Department reviews its business requirements on an on-going basis, there are no plans at present to return to the Navan Road location. The building was subsequently allocated to An Garda Síochána (AGS) on a temporary basis and they are still actively using it. The length of time they will remain there has not yet been decided The future use of the property is under consideration in light of office accommodation requirements across OPW’s client base, including An Garda Síochána, and the wider policy objectives of Government.\n\nI have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Garda authorities. Unfortunately, the information was not received in time. I will contact the Deputy directly once the information is to hand.\n\nAs the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the administration and management of An Garda Síochána, including the procurement, allocation, and effective and efficient use of Garda equipment. As Minister, I have no role in such matters. The Government is, however, committed to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs to deliver a modern, fit-for-purpose policing service. Budget 2024 provides funding of over €2.35 billion for An Garda Síochána.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Air Support Unit (GASU) is a national resource based at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Co. Dublin. The unit is under the direction and control of Assistant Commissioner, Organised and Serious Crime, and the operational control of Detective Chief Superintendent, Operational Support Services. The unit provides a 24-hour proactive and reactive service in support of operational Gardaí on the ground and specialist units. I am advised that the capability of the current Garda aircraft fleet is constantly being evaluated. I am further advised that there are currently two helicopters attached to the GASU, a Eurocopter EC 135 T2 and a EC135 T2+ which were delivered in 2001 and 2007 respectively. I am informed that an application was made to replace these aircraft, and government agreed to the purchase of a fixed wing plane and a helicopter.  I am advised that a new rotary and fixed wing aircraft is expected be delivered by respective contractors to An Garda Síochána in quarter 1 of 2025.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 880, 881, 882, 883, 884, 885 and 925 together.As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the administration and management of An Garda Síochána, including the distribution of Garda members between the different Garda units and Divisions. As Minister, I have no role in such matters. I can, however, assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to building stronger, safer communities and a strengthened, well-resourced Garda Síochána is central to this policy. This commitment is demonstrated by the unprecedented provision of more than €2.3 billion to the Garda Vote this year, which is allowing for sustained and ongoing recruitment and investment in new equipment and new vehicles.  In addition to new recruits, the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will support the redeployment of Gardaí from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country. The new model will see larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing. I am advised by the Garda authorities that as of 29 February 2024, the latest date for when figures are available, there was a total of 13,930 Garda members nationwide. This represents an increase of almost 9% since the end of December 2015. In addition, the civilianisation programme has freed up almost 900 Garda members from back office work for front line policing work since 2015.Information in relation to the allocation of Gardaí by Division and Station can be found at the following link:",

  ["The Celtic Interconnector is a proposed 700 MW electricity interconnector between Brittany and East Cork, promoted and developed by the Irish electricity Transmission System Operator, EirGrid, and its French counterpart, Reseau de Transporte d’Électricite (RTÉ). The project remains on target for energisation in 2026 with takeover planned for March 2027. Construction activity has commenced in France and as of November 2023 on-land cable works for the Celtic Interconnector project commenced in Ireland. Cable manufacturing timelines remain as per contracted timeframes and some marine survey works were undertaken in 2023 by the cable contractor. On 13 November 2023, Ireland and France marked the commencement of construction on the Celtic Interconnector project with a visit from a French Government Delegation. The start of construction on the project signifies an important step forward for the energy future of both countries. It will include enough capacity to power 450,000 homes and will create a direct electricity link from Ireland to the EU Internal Energy Market, as well as enhanced market competition and security of electricity supply, to the benefit of Irish and French electricity customers."
   "As part of the governance and oversight of the Climate Action Plan process, the Department of An Taoiseach publish, on a quarterly basis, progress reports on the status of the actions within the Climate Action Plan (CAP) for 2021 and 2023. These reports are available online: www.gov.ie/en/publication/55fde-climate-action-important-publications All actions assigned to the agriculture sector under CAP21 were completed and/or carried over to the CAP23. Similarly, the draft CAP24 which was published on December 20 2023 will build on the actions of CAP23 and/or carry forward any delayed actions. These actions will be progressed and monitored throughout the course of CAP24 as per previous plans.  Under CAP23, there were 53 actions assigned to my Department of which 45 have been successfully completed. The incomplete actions will be prioritised for completion as soon as possible."
   "Actions committed to under the Climate Action Plan 2023 are reported on through progress reports prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach and published quarterly. In 2023, my Department reported on 10 actions in total, and provided final updates on the delivery status of these actions for review in early January.  Pending final confirmation from the Department of the Taoiseach, it is anticipated that the delivery rate of CAP23 commitments for my Department will stand at approximately 50%, with three ‘high-impact’ actions delayed.  I am satisfied that the majority of these outstanding actions are subject to short-term issues and they will not impact on our ability to achieve my Department’s emissions reduction targets. The delayed high impact actions include the publication of two roadmaps – these are the roadmap for the decarbonisation of industrial heat in manufacturing and the roadmap on the retrofit of commercial buildings. Drafts of both roadmaps have been produced and are being considered by the relevant Working Groups under the Heat and Built Environment Taskforce. They are expected to be presented to the Taskforce and published in Q1. A further action, to identify actions to accelerate and drive system wide delivery of industrial heat decarbonisation, will be completed alongside the roadmap for the decarbonisation of industrial heat. The third high impact action for delivery in Q4 was the completion of a report on ‘Reducing embodied carbon in cement and concrete through public procurement in Ireland’. Final edits are being made and it is expected that this action will also be completed in Q1. While it is regrettable that a higher proportion of CAP23 actions were not able to be completed before the end of 2023, the four delayed actions are fully drafted, at final stages of negotiation and agreement and will be completed by the end of Q1 2024. One other delayed action assigned to the NSAI, to develop a certification scheme for energy efficient retrofit of dwellings, has been delayed until H2 2024 due to a high demand for construction products certification and an effort to focus on delivery in that area. For actions under the Climate Action Plan 2021, my Department had a completion rate of 92%, compared to a cross-Government average of 79%. A process was undertaken to determine the future of each incomplete action. Some actions were deemed high impact enough to retain and incorporate into CAP23, while others were merged to increase their impact and included as new actions. Others they were deemed too low impact or represented business as usual for the department and therefore no longer required reporting."
   "Recognising the key role of community climate action in our transition to a climate neutral society, last month, I launched a fund of €27 million from the Climate Action Fund for local organisations working to build low carbon communities.

The first tranche of €50m issued to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in late 2021.  The previous Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 to 2020 saw overall investment of €210m issued to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in annual grant funding. This funding enabled schools to invest in appropriate digital infrastructure to enable the embedding of the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment. Funding of €50m secured as part of Ireland's National Recovery and Resilience Plan under the NextGenerationEU Recovery and Resilience Facility also issued to all recognised schools in the free education scheme to support learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide in late 2021. My Department intends to pay the next tranche of ICT grant funding before the end of the 2023 to 2024 school year. The specific timing for issue of the ICT grant is subject to the availability of Exchequer funding and the wider capital needs of the Department including the building programme to ensure the supply of school accommodation. As part of the forthcoming Review of the National Development Plan, my Department’s aim is to provide better clarity and certainty for schools on the timelines for payment of minor works and ICT grant funding."

These 300 projects currently at construction involve a total State investment of over €1.2bn.  There are also 90 projects currently at the tender stage including a further 28 new school buildings. All of these new school buildings are flagship projects in their area and transform the education infrastructure for those school communities.  This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities.  Since 2018 the school referred to by the Deputy has received over €93,000 in capital funding comprising of Minor Works funding and Furniture & Equipment funding.

It should be noted that: The total number of unique children availing of CCSP over 2022 and 2023 is identical, as the CCSP scheme is a legacy scheme and as such has been closed to new applicants since the introduction of NCS in 2019. The TEC programme closed to new applicants in 2020, final legacy payments concluded in 2022 and the programme has now expired.\n\nThe Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 was published last year and is underpinned by an investment of €200m to support its implementation, committed to under Ireland’s National Development Plan (NDP). The first tranche of €50m issued to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in late 2021.  The previous Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 to 2020 saw overall investment of €210m issued to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in annual grant funding. This funding enabled schools to invest in appropriate digital infrastructure to enable the embedding of the use of digital technology in teaching, learning and assessment. Funding of €50m secured as part of Ireland's National Recovery and Resilience Plan under the NextGenerationEU Recovery and Resilience Facility also issued to all recognised schools in the free education scheme to support learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide in late 2021. My Department intends to pay the next tranche of ICT grant funding before the end of the 2023 to 2024 school year. The specific timing for issue of the ICT grant is subject to the availability of Exchequer funding and the wider capital needs of the Department including the building programme to ensure the supply of school accommodation. As part of the forthcoming Review of the National Development Plan, my Department’s aim is to provide better clarity and certainty for schools on the timelines for payment of minor works and ICT grant funding.\n\nIn response to the Deputy's query please see below details of funding provided to schools in County Meath by My Department under the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS), and the Additional Accommodation Scheme (ASA) for the period of 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023, in tabular form: \n\nA request for additional information was requested from the Deputy. This will be forwarded directly once it is received.\n\nSince 2020, my Department has invested in the region of €4.5 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of over 800 school building projects with construction currently underway at approximately 300 other projects, which includes 31 new school buildings.  These 300 projects currently at construction involve a total State investment of over €1.2bn.  There are also 90 projects currently at the tender stage including a further 28 new school buildings. All of these new school buildings are flagship projects in their area and transform the education infrastructure for those school communities.  This is a record level of investment in our schools and highlights the Government’s very strong track record of delivery in providing additional capacity and modern facilities for our school communities.  Since 2018 the school referred to by the Deputy has received over €93,000 in capital funding comprising of Minor Works funding and Furniture & Equipment funding. The funding provided from 2023 to date is detailed below.    The current status of all projects and completions from 2010 to date is listed on a county by county basis at www.gov.ie and is updated on a regular basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.",

   "The CSO estimates the number of foreign residents visiting Ireland from two sources. Firstly, it uses passenger data provided by airport authorities and sea ferry operators to determine the total number of passengers entering and leaving Ireland through all the main airports and seaports respectively. Secondly, the CSO conducts passenger surveys at the airports and seaports to differentiate these passenger flows into Irish and foreign residents. Historically, the CSO has been unable to compile statistics on cross-border visits, in part as much of this relates to vehicular traffic over the border, so Northern Ireland residents and other foreign residents entering Ireland cross border are excluded from the estimates.  The following table sets out the total numbers of arrivals and departures from airports and sea ports over the period 2019 – 2022.    In 2019 an estimated 10,808,000 trips were made to Ireland by overseas foreign resident visitors. These comprised 1,450,000 same-day visits (including 969,000 air transfers) and 9,357,000 overnight visits. Unfortunately, the CSO does not have comparable statistics for the years 2020-2022, as the passenger surveys at airports and seaports were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic for reasons of public safety. As such, the breakdown of international and domestic visitors not available for those years. The CSO resumed full scale survey operations at airports and seaports in 2023. Results for 2023 are in the process of compilation and are expected to be released in March of this year."
   "Wildlife crime is a serious issue seen across many jurisdictions that poses a threat to our biodiversity and the sustainable development of countless communities.  Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity contribute to the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework through National Biodiversity Action Plans. Ireland's 4th National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP) 2023- 2030 was published in January and sets out Ireland’s vision for biodiversity, with a “whole of government, whole of society” approach to the governance and conservation of nature. This is the first NBAP to be published on a statutory basis, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2023, and includes targets to ensure that the governance and legislative framework for biodiversity conservation is robust, clear and enforceable, strengthening action on wildlife crime. This target will be underpinned by enhanced collaboration between the National Parks and Wildlife Service, An Garda Síochána, Revenue’s Customs Service and other relevant authorities to ensure adequate training and resourcing to enforce environmental and wildlife legislation. Each entity responsible for actions within the NBAP will provide an annual update on progress and will contribute to an Interim and Final Review of the Plan. My colleague, Minister O'Brien will bring a progress report to Cabinet at least once a year. Prosecuting breaches of wildlife legislation can be an effective deterrent to wildlife crime. Taking a case from reporting and investigative stage through to successful prosecution can be challenging. Nevertheless, the work of NPWS staff across the organisation has seen an increase in prosecution cases for breaches of wildlife legislation taken of 39% in 2023 compared to 2022 figures, with 169 cases sent by NPWS to the Chief State Solicitors office since 2019 and it has successfully closed over 118 cases since 2020.  A breakdown of cases initiated by the NPWS with the CSSO for each of the years 2014 to 2023 will be forwarded to the Deputy once compiled. Whilst bringing perpetrators of wildlife crime to justice is crucial, ensuring compliance in the first instance is also of critical importance. NPWS's capability to monitor compliance, detect, prevent, educate and outreach as well as take enforcement action is being greatly enhanced through the recruitment of additional NPWS staff across the organisation. A dedicated NPWS Directorate for Wildlife Enforcement and Nature Protection is now leading on the development of NPWS policies and strategies for wildlife crime. The Wildlife Act is also being reviewed to improve its enforceability, and a public consultation on this will be announced shortly. I am strongly committed to supporting the efforts of authorities to fulfil their enforcement functions under wildlife legislation as effectively as possible and working to achieve increased compliance.

   "There are several significant capital investment projects proposed for the University Hospital Galway Campus, including the Replacement Laboratories, Emergency Department (ED) Women & Children’s Block, a Regional Cancer Centre, a new Elective Hospital and a Surgical Hub. In September 2023, Saolta established a Galway University Hospital (GUH) Capital Programme Oversight Board to develop an integrated master plan to support the phased delivery of capital investment at GUH. This board is currently in the process of preparing a detailed, robust and comprehensive master plan.   Elective Hospital and Surgical Hub  Significant additional capacity to better enable the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care will be provided through a national network of dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals. The Preliminary Business Case, approved by Government in December 2022, identified Merlin Park as the preferred site for a new Elective Hospital in Galway. Since that approval, the HSE has been progressing its plans, defining the shape and scale of the new hospitals as well as progressing procurement, ICT and workforce planning. The HSE is also progressing the procurement of an integrated Design Team to provide the full scope of design services for the Elective Hospitals. The HSE is also addressing waiting lists in the shorter term by expediting the development of ‘Surgical Hubs’ at locations across the country. Planning permission for the Galway Surgical Hub at Merlin Park has been granted and the procurement process for a construction contractor is in final stages."
   "The Government is extremely conscious of the distress overcrowded Emergency Departments cause and the very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country. This winter is the first winter we are using an all-year approach to urgent and emergency care, since the switch last year from annual winter plans recognising that the required investment, changes and supports go beyond winter. The Urgent and Emergency Care Operational Plan for 2023 was signed off by Government in July. The 2023 UEC Operational Plan will be the foundation for the 2024 UEC Operational plan, providing continuation and sustainability to the improvements achieved thus far. A key priority of the Department of Health and the HSE is the improvement of ED Patient Experience Times (PET) and reform of service delivery across the entire health system is a key part of achieving this. The health service is concentrating on improving PET for the over-75s as a priority patient cohort and the most likely to require longer hospital stays. Delivering additional and extended hours for senior decision makers and staff integral to patient flow significantly improves the weekend discharge rates, which is good measure for the delivery of a seven-day service on behalf of patients. The UEC Operational Plan focuses on improving four key performance indicators and has set the following targets:  • No patient aged over 75 years will wait more than 24 hours in ED’s nationally.  • The total number of Delayed Transfer of Care (DTOC) patients is 440 • The average monthly trolley count at 8am not to exceed 320  • The average length of stay for those over 14 days not to exceed 28 days."
   "The introduction of a standardised national approach to electronic discharges would certainly improve the timeliness and quality of discharges from one care setting to another. Indeed, electronic discharges are already deployed at a number of our larger acute hospitals. The communication technology is already well established with discharge information being issued as a structured message via Healthlink, meaning it can be ingested into downstream systems, most GP practice systems. The use of Healthmail instead of Healthlink, whilst speeding up the process of issuing discharge summaries by avoiding the need to use post, would not help to standardise the process for preparation or indeed the content of discharge summaries. The fact that we have different processes and systems within existing hospitals - where discharge information must be collated from in order to produce the discharge summary - is the real challenge here. My department has engaged with the HSE on this subject before because of the obvious potential to improve patient care and improve efficiency both within hospitals and community settings. I can assure the deputy the we will continue to support opportunities with the HSE to adopt electronic discharge capabilities across the health system, including information on medications, which is critical to safe patient care. Indeed, there is already funding provided within the national service plan for 2024 to support hospital sites that can implement electronic discharge capabilities, leveraging the existing Healthlink communications technology. Structured data from electronic discharges will also form an important part of the national shared care record, the technology for which the HSE is going to market for this year."

  "You are a responsible and trustworthy senior government official.\n       Provide an answer to the user's question, using only the context\n       provided. Answer as if you are talking directly to the user and make sure\n       the answer is neutral and formal.

If you can't find any information in the context to answer\n       the question, then reply with \"I am unable to answer this question with\n       the information I have available.\" \n\n CONTEXT: As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.\n\nThere are several significant capital investment projects proposed for the University Hospital Galway Campus, including the Replacement Laboratories, Emergency Department (ED) Women & Children’s Block, a Regional Cancer Centre, a new Elective Hospital and a Surgical Hub. In September 2023, Saolta established a Galway University Hospital (GUH) Capital Programme Oversight Board to develop an integrated master plan to support the phased delivery of capital investment at GUH. This board is currently in the process of preparing a detailed, robust and comprehensive master plan.   Elective Hospital and Surgical Hub  Significant additional capacity to better enable the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care will be provided through a national network of dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals. The Preliminary Business Case, approved by Government in December 2022, identified Merlin Park as the preferred site for a new Elective Hospital in Galway. Since that approval, the HSE has been progressing its plans, defining the shape and scale of the new hospitals as well as progressing procurement, ICT and workforce planning. The HSE is also progressing the procurement of an integrated Design Team to provide the full scope of design services for the Elective Hospitals. The HSE is also addressing waiting lists in the shorter term by expediting the development of ‘Surgical Hubs’ at locations across the country. Planning permission for the Galway Surgical Hub at Merlin Park has been granted and the procurement process for a construction contractor is in final stages.\n\nThe Government is extremely conscious of the distress overcrowded Emergency Departments cause and the very challenging working conditions in hospitals throughout the country. This winter is the first winter we are using an all-year approach to urgent and emergency care, since the switch last year from annual winter plans recognising that the required investment, changes and supports go beyond winter. The Urgent and Emergency Care Operational Plan for 2023 was signed off by Government in July. The 2023 UEC Operational Plan will be the foundation for the 2024 UEC Operational plan, providing continuation and sustainability to the improvements achieved thus far. A key priority of the Department of Health and the HSE is the improvement of ED Patient Experience Times (PET) and reform of service delivery across the entire health system is a key part of achieving this. The health service is concentrating on improving PET for the over-75s as a priority patient cohort and the most likely to require longer hospital stays. Delivering additional and extended hours for senior decision makers and staff integral to patient flow significantly improves the weekend discharge rates, which is good measure for the delivery of a seven-day service on behalf of patients. The UEC Operational Plan focuses on improving four key performance indicators and has set the following targets:  • No patient aged over 75 years will wait more than 24 hours in ED’s nationally.  • The total number of Delayed Transfer of Care (DTOC) patients is 440 • The average monthly trolley count at 8am not to exceed 320  • The average length of stay for those over 14 days not to exceed 28 days.\n\nThe introduction of a standardised national approach to electronic discharges would certainly improve the timeliness and quality of discharges from one care setting to another. Indeed, electronic discharges are already deployed at a number of our larger acute hospitals. The communication technology is already well established with discharge information being issued as a structured message via Healthlink, meaning it can be ingested into downstream systems, most GP practice systems. The use of Healthmail instead of Healthlink, whilst speeding up the process of issuing discharge summaries by avoiding the need to use post, would not help to standardise the process for preparation or indeed the content of discharge summaries. The fact that we have different processes and systems within existing hospitals - where discharge information must be collated from in order to produce the discharge summary - is the real challenge here. My department has engaged with the HSE on this subject before because of the obvious potential to improve patient care and improve efficiency both within hospitals and community settings. I can assure the deputy the we will continue to support opportunities with the HSE to adopt electronic discharge capabilities across the health system, including information on medications, which is critical to safe patient care. Indeed, there is already funding provided within the national service plan for 2024 to support hospital sites that can implement electronic discharge capabilities, leveraging the existing Healthlink communications technology. Structured data from electronic discharges will also form an important part of the national shared care record, the technology for which the HSE is going to market for this year.\n\nAs this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. As the Deputy may be aware, management and administrative grade staff in the Fórsa union in the HSE commenced industrial action on Friday, 6 October. As a consequence of this industrial action, members in these grades are not engaging with political forums or processes. As a result, the question asked by the Deputy may be delayed in receiving a response directly from the HSE.",

   "Community Training Centres (CTCs) are non-profit making companies with governing boards that are broadly representative of the community. Since 1977, CTCs have been involved in innovative training for marginalised groups and since the introduction of the Youthreach programme in 1989, their focus has been on Early School Leavers. There are currently two CTCs operating in the area mentioned by the Deputy, which receive funding from City of Dublin Education and Training Board. These are the Lourdes Youth and Community Services (LYCS) CTC and the St. Vincent’s CTC.   While both Centres each have capacity for 40 learners, there are currently 28 learners enrolled in LYCS CTC and 33 learners enrolled in St. Vincent’s CTC. The Lourdes CTC has recently relocated to the Metropolitan Building on James Joyce Street. City of Dublin ETB also offers the Youthreach Programme in 2 Youthreach Centres operated by the ETB and located in North Great George’s Street and in Parnell Square.  The capacity of these two Youthreach Centres is 126 and the enrolment in late 2023 was 113. Having regard to the excess capacity in the two CTCs involved and the wider Youthreach provision in the area, City of Dublin ETB has no plans to expand the available provision beyond the current capacity at the present time.  The funding for the two CTCs in 2024 will be dictated by learner numbers in each centre, as per previous years funding allocation.  Regarding the north inner city more broadly, my Department is represented on the North East Inner City (NEIC) Taskforce.

   "Some €69 million has been allocated over the period 2023-2025 to the early learning and childcare sector under the revised National Development Plan (NDP). This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare across three pillars:• Building Blocks - Improvement Grant;                                                                                           • Building Blocks - Capacity Grant; and• Building Blocks - Innovation Grant.

  ["Firstly, can I reassure the Deputy that the move to a five-day week offering for Kilmainham Gaol is a very temporary measure.  It is with great regret that my officials had to take this short-term measure as a last resort in the context of a recruitment shortfall which has resulted in a reduced staffing roster at the Gaol. Unfortunately, the current arrangements arise from the recent departure of a number of permanent Guide staff who took up new roles outside the organisation in the latter end of 2023. There has been a short but unavoidable delay in the recruitment of permanent staff to backfill these positions which regrettably has resulted in a reduced workforce to staff and operate the Gaol and museum. This situation is currently being addressed as a matter of priority and it is envisaged that the site will return to seven-day operations by mid to end of February.  While the site may be closed generally to the public on Mondays and Tuesdays for the next few weeks, please be assured that tour bookings which were booked and confirmed are being honoured by a skeleton staff. This current arrangement also ensures that the site operates as normal with full opening to public Wednesday to Sunday each week which are generally the busiest days. It is hoped that we will be successful in recruiting new staff for the Gaol in the upcoming Permanent Guide competitions to fill the current vacancies.  The OPW is taking this opportunity to undertake some outstanding maintenance tasks within the Gaol."

It is with great regret that my officials had to take this short-term measure as a last resort in the context of a recruitment shortfall which has resulted in a reduced staffing roster at the Gaol. Unfortunately, the current arrangements arise from the recent departure of a number of permanent Guide staff who took up new roles outside the organisation in the latter end of 2023. There has been a short but unavoidable delay in the recruitment of permanent staff to backfill these positions which regrettably has resulted in a reduced workforce to staff and operate the Gaol and museum. This situation is currently being addressed as a matter of priority and it is envisaged that the site will return to seven-day operations by mid to end of February.  While the site may be closed generally to the public on Mondays and Tuesdays for the next few weeks, please be assured that tour bookings which were booked and confirmed are being honoured by a skeleton staff. This current arrangement also ensures that the site operates as normal with full opening to public Wednesday to Sunday each week which are generally the busiest days. It is hoped that we will be successful in recruiting new staff for the Gaol in the upcoming Permanent Guide competitions to fill the current vacancies.  The OPW is taking this opportunity to undertake some outstanding maintenance tasks within the Gaol.\n\nAvailable records for this query exist from 2014. 12 tour guides who formerly worked in Kilmainham Gaol, on both seasonal and permanent contracts, are now working in other OPW heritage sites.\n\nThe function of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-2014 is to ensure the long-term conservation of national monuments.

  ["An adequate supply and mix of housing across all tenures is critical to balancing supply and demand in the housing market, including for home ownership, social housing and private rental.  Under Housing Policy Objective 1.10 of Housing for All, Government committed to introducing an ‘owner-occupier' guarantee to enable local authorities specify the proportion of houses and duplexes in a development for owner-occupiers. To this end, measures were introduced by Government in May 2021 to disincentivise and prohibit the bulk buying of such properties.  The measures included a higher 10% stamp duty levy on cumulative purchase of 10 or more residential properties, excluding apartments, in a 12-month period to disincentivise the bulk purchase of homes by institutional investors.     At the same time, Section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities 'Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing' effectively introduced an ‘owner-occupier’ guarantee by ensuring new ‘own-door’ houses and duplex units in housing developments could no longer be bulk-purchased by institutional investors in a manner that displaces individual purchasers or social and affordable housing.  The guidelines provide for a form of condition to be inserted in applicable new planning permissions requiring all houses to be made available for sale and first occupation by separate, individual households for a period of years after completion (only applicable to houses and duplex units in mixed developments and not apartments).   Complementary measures were also introduced via the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021, which provides that local authorities must ensure home ownership as a tenure type is provided for and estimated in their respective housing strategies. To this end, the Act introduces the principle of home ownership as a specific tenure type in a local authority housing strategy, with particular regard to developments of houses and duplexes, and gives further legislative effect to the Section 28 Guidelines issued in 2021.  Some 39,900 homes have been granted planning permission with conditions prohibiting the bulk purchase by, or multiple sale to, a single purchaser between May 2021 and December 2023. The suggestion that institutional investors are crowding out prospective owner-occupiers are not borne out by official data, which show institutional investors still comprise a relatively small proportion of residential properties purchased annually. In this context, and given the scale of new residential properties ring-fenced for owner-occupiers, I am satisfied that the actions which this Government have put in place have been effective and further intervention is not necessary at this time.  Planning permission for this development was granted by Fingal County Council on 30 November 2018. Permission was subsequently granted by An Bord Pleanála on 8 May 2019 following a  third party appeal.  Therefore, the restrictions introduced in May 2021 on bulk purchasing through the Section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities “Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing” would not apply in this case."
   "I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 105, inclusive, together. Waterways Ireland proposes to update the Shannon Bye-laws and Canal Bye-laws which are more than 30 years old and no longer fit for purpose. The needs of users have changed, environmental landscape and health and safety considerations have developed significantly and the waterways themselves have been transformed over the past thirty years. The purpose of updating the Bye-laws is to make the waterways safer for those using the waterways, blueways and greenways, and continue to provide a valuable recreational experience for everyone to enjoy.

Waterways Ireland has considered those submissions carefully and has made changes to the proposed Byelaws to endeavour to deal equitably with legitimate matters of concern raised, while maintaining a balanced focus on the needs of all users of the waterways and the public. Some of those changes include: • Introduction and extension of a five-day rule on Canal harbours • Re-instatement of winter moorings on the Shannon Navigation • Removal of a proposed three-day rule at harbours • Removal of speed limit proposals on Greenways • Reducing the proposed houseboat permit fees in suburban areas  Waterways Ireland opened the second phase of the public consultation on January 15 2024, inviting members of the public and interested parties to have their say on the new, revised version of the Shannon Navigation and Canal Byelaws. This second phase of the public consultation remains open until 26 February 2024 and offers an opportunity to consider the revisions to the proposed Byelaws as well as an additional opportunity for the public and all users of the waterways to have their say.

   "Local authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock and the management of their estates, which includes facilitating tenants’ participation in estate management. "
   "Under the National Raised Bog Restoration programme, conservation measures are undertaken on Ireland's protected raised bogs to restore these important habitats to favourable conservation status. This is done by restoring the water table to a level where the bog is wet enough to support the growth of sphagnum moss, which assists in the formation of peat.  It is important to note that the restoration of peatlands, including bogs, at an adequate scale can help reduce flooding in their catchments, as their capacity to hold water and release it slowly is greatly enhanced.  Before commencing rehabilitation work at each site, detailed restoration plans and drainage management plans (supported by comprehensive hydrological analysis where appropriate) are designed for that site. These are tailored to the site in question and take account of the surrounding lands.  Proposed restoration work planned on any peatlands, including bogs, as part of current or future restoration programmes will similarly require thorough analysis before work is done, including the drawing up of site-specific restoration and drainage management plans.  While the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) conducts very comprehensive preparatory actions and reports prior to any restoration being carried out, in the unlikely event that neighbouring landowners are affected by the work, the NPWS will engage and work with the affected parties in order to resolve any issues. If any landowner has particular queries or concerns relating to this matter, they can contact peatlandsconservation@npws.gov.ie ."],

Under Housing Policy Objective 1.10 of Housing for All, Government committed to introducing an ‘owner-occupier' guarantee to enable local authorities specify the proportion of houses and duplexes in a development for owner-occupiers. To this end, measures were introduced by Government in May 2021 to disincentivise and prohibit the bulk buying of such properties.  The measures included a higher 10% stamp duty levy on cumulative purchase of 10 or more residential properties, excluding apartments, in a 12-month period to disincentivise the bulk purchase of homes by institutional investors.     At the same time, Section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities 'Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing' effectively introduced an ‘owner-occupier’ guarantee by ensuring new ‘own-door’ houses and duplex units in housing developments could no longer be bulk-purchased by institutional investors in a manner that displaces individual purchasers or social and affordable housing.

   "At the outset, I wish to reassure the Deputy that I recognise the concerns felt by many local community groups across the country around the cost and availability of insurance cover. Insurance reform is a key priority for this Government and is being delivered via the Action Plan for Insurance Reform with the vast bulk of the actions now either delivered or initiated. Accordingly, I understand there are providers that specialise in this area and who may take advantage of the improving insurance market conditions to expand their footprint in the sector. Last summer, one of the key “asks” of both the insurance industry and reform campaigners was delivered – the rebalancing of the Duty of Care. The amendments to the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995 will deliver major benefits to businesses, sporting groups and community and voluntary organisations in particular. In time, cost savings from reduced claims should also help to lower premiums for such organisations, particularly those engaged in high-risk/high-footfall areas, where claims associated with ‘slips, trips and falls’ are more prevalent. This should benefit, in particular, businesses in the tourism, hospitality and recreation/activity sectors including local community events. One of the main changes is that the law now allows for a broader range of scenarios where it can be shown that a visitor or customer has voluntarily assumed a risk resulting in harm. In addition to being a legislative change, it is hoped that this signals the start of a cultural shift surrounding the claims environment in Ireland, which would bring us more into line with our European Union peers. At the same time, the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, chaired by Minister Carroll MacNeill, continues to work to expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants. It has engaged closely with IDA Ireland to promote Ireland as positive environment to write insurance, and is also in regular contact with areas that are experiencing insurance issues. The number of ‘pinch-points’ have decreased significantly with insurance now available in previously difficult areas such as: equestrian activities; inflatable hire; ice-skating; sport clubs; play centres; and SMEs. Building on this success, the Office will continue to facilitate connecting consumers with relevant stakeholders in order to assist sectors in which insurance difficulties arise.   Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that it is Government's intention to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors in the economy, including the staging of local community events. We will continue to monitor developments, including through the Cabinet Sub Committee for Insurance Reform."

We will continue to monitor developments, including through the Cabinet Sub Committee for Insurance Reform.\n\nSince 1st January 2019 to date, officials of my Department have engaged with representatives of the named organisation on 18 occasions. Most of these engagements took place at fora and events at which both organisations were involved, as well as a smaller number of bilateral engagements. In addition, I participated in events with the organisation on three occasions during the period concerned and met with them last year.\n\nWindEurope is one of the largest gathering of Europe’s wind industry with over 12,000 attendees and over 500 exhibitors expected to attend the event in Bilbao this March. I understand over 16,000 people attended the same event in Copenhagen last year. This event offers a huge opportunity for Ireland to announce our plans in relation to offshore wind, including the recently published As such, officials from my Department’s Offshore Wind Strategy Unit will attend the event given the large number of attendees expected and the importance of the event in highlighting Ireland’s offshore ambitions to the rest of the world. Attendance at WindEurope directly relates to action 20 in  My officials will be joined by representatives from the all-of-Government Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce (OWDT), which includes representation from DECC, D/Transport, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, SEAI, as well as those working in the Irish wind industry at an Ireland Pavilion at the event Officials will perform a number of tasks at WindEurope such as visiting a nearby floating offshore wind demonstrator site, attending relevant conference sessions to build our knowledge and expertise in this area, and meeting with stakeholders across the offshore wind sector including a range of companies and delegations from other like-minded countries. Furthermore, officials will be available at the Ireland Pavilion throughout the event including at a reception to discuss Ireland’s long-term offshore wind plans with other representatives from the OWDT, where my officials will speak on the Offshore Wind Industrial Strategy.\n\nMy Department in its current configuration was established in September 2020. Neither I nor officials from my Department have had any direct engagements, including online meetings, webinars, briefings and in-person meetings, with the National Women’s Council of Ireland since then. However, I am advised that a representative from the NWCI attended the following events in which I or my officials were in attendance; March 2020 'Celebrate the Changemaker', November 2020 Women's Parliamentary Caucus in which the NWCI provided secretariat support, April 2021 the Director of the NWCI attended a meeting of Women's Voices, and a representative spoke at the launch of the Advisory Committee on the Representation of Women and Women’s Stories within the collections of the National Cultural Institutions in September 2023. The Deputy may wish to note also that my Department is represented on the Steering Committee for the National Strategy on Women and Girls chaired by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the membership of which includes representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  With regard to Agencies/Bodies under my Department's remit, such arrangements would be an operational matter for the respective Agency/Body.",

This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Manager to progress the project through the relevant stages of architectural planning, tender and construction. The Invitation to Tender issued in April 2023, as part of a bundle of projects issued to the Department's Framework of Design & Build Contractors. Given the scale of works involving new purpose built accommodation for 10 schools, a number of which are on campus sites including the school referred to by the Deputy, the tender process involves a very large amount of documentation and drawings and takes approximately 8-12 months. Tender returns have been received and are currently being evaluated.  This bundle comprises 10 school projects which are all flagship projects for their local school communities. Given the magnitude of this large scale investment, this tender evaluation process takes time for the Department's technical staff and project management team to adequately and appropriately analyse. The Department is very conscious of the urgency in getting these projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, delivered as quickly as possible.  Once a Contractor has been appointed, it is anticipated that construction would commence shortly thereafter. My Department has delivered interim accommodation on site for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 school years, in line with enrolment figures agreed with the school's patron body and will continue to liaise with the school's patron body in relation to interim accommodation needs pending delivery of the permanent accommodation for the school."

This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Manager to progress the project through the relevant stages of architectural planning, tender and construction. The Invitation to Tender issued in April 2023, as part of a bundle of projects issued to the Department's Framework of Design & Build Contractors. Given the scale of works involving new purpose built accommodation for 10 schools, a number of which are on campus sites including the school referred to by the Deputy, the tender process involves a very large amount of documentation and drawings and takes approximately 8-12 months. Tender returns have been received and are currently being evaluated.  This bundle comprises 10 school projects which are all flagship projects for their local school communities. Given the magnitude of this large scale investment, this tender evaluation process takes time for the Department's technical staff and project management team to adequately and appropriately analyse. The Department is very conscious of the urgency in getting these projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, delivered as quickly as possible.  Once a Contractor has been appointed, it is anticipated that construction would commence shortly thereafter. My Department has delivered interim accommodation on site for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 school years, in line with enrolment figures agreed with the school's patron body and will continue to liaise with the school's patron body in relation to interim accommodation needs pending delivery of the permanent accommodation for the school.\n\nSOLAS has advised that the numbers of students enrolling in Level 5 pre-nursing PLC courses were 1,369 in 2022/23 and 1,281 in 2023/24. In addition, for the first time in September 2023, students entered new tertiary programmes outside of the CAO system.  Starting their programme in further education, they will progress seamlessly to guaranteed places to complete a fully-accredited degree in higher education.  54 students commenced new tertiary BSc (Honours) Degrees in Nursing.\n\nThe department had a total of 56 Twitter video posts between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023, of which 51 (91%) utilised closed captioned/subtitled. 8 (14%) of the posts featured Irish Sign Language (ISL) A total of 24 videos were posted on LinkedIn between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023, of which 21 (87%) utilised closed captioned/subtitled. 3 (12%) of the posts featured Irish Sign Language (ISL_. The department does not hold the statistics for its public bodies and agencies.\n\nPlease find attached requested data. The National Council of Special Education has Special Educational Needs Organisers who are available to work with families to support the transition of students from early intervention classes to primary special or mainstream classes as appropriate.   Notes: Data is taken from the Primary Online Database, (POD) and represents enrolment of pupils for each year with ASD Early Intervention as their class type in POD and there movement in subsequent years.  Using 2019 as an example it shows the outcomes of pupils enrolled in 2019, 654, in the following year 2020-21, with 641 pupils subsequently enrolled across class and school categories in 2020-21.

Direct entry to the FLR is limited to personnel who are departing the PDF and have undertaken, either voluntarily or on foot of a contractual commitment, to complete a period of service in the FLR.The Military Authorities have advised that as of 30 November 2023, the strength of the First Line Reserve (FLR) is 282, I can confirm that the FLR is an area, which will be examined, in the context of work arising from the Commission on the Defence Forces (CoDF).  As an interim measure, the Department continues to receive business cases from the Military Authorities for applications for officers wishing to join the FLR. The applications are assessed by the Minister on a case by case basis having regard to the particular skills-sets of the officer. In 2023, a total of 2 applications were received and approved while 1 application from 2022 was also approved and a further 1 received at the end of 2023 is under consideration. I would like to assure the Deputy that it is my intention, and that of the Chief of Staff, to ensure that the momentum behind the regeneration of the RDF will be maintained, thereby enabling us, going forward, to create a Reserve Defence Force that can seamlessly train, operate and deploy with the Permanent Defence Force, both nationally and internationally.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 444 and 445 together. The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an independent, statutory body under the aegis of my Department, established on 1st October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015. The WRC’s primary functions include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services. Table 1 sets out the amount in unpaid wages that has been returned to workers following  workplace investigations by the Workplace Relations Commission Inspectorate by sector, and value of wages, in 2023. Table 2 sets out the number of inspections carried out by the Workplace Relations Commission in 2023, by NACE sector; the number of breaches detected, the type of breaches detected; and the counties in which the breaches were detected. \n\nAs this question refers to service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. As the Deputy may be aware, the industrial action that commenced on Friday 6th October, by management and administrative grades in Fórsa Trade Union in the HSE, will impact on the response times to Parliamentary Questions and Representations.\n\nStatutory and operational responsibility for the delivery of child protection and welfare services is a matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The Deputy is seeking information in relation to an operational matter for Tusla. Consequently, I have referred the matter to Tusla, and requested that a direct response be provided to the Deputy.\n\nThe First Line Reserve (FLR) is intended to provide a pool of trained personnel who are available at short notice to supplement Permanent Defence Force (PDF) units in times of emergency. There is currently no set establishment for the FLR. The existing regulatory framework provides for former members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) to join the Army Reserve or Naval Service Reserve. This is subject to their meeting certain criteria. Direct entry to the FLR is currently limited to personnel who are departing the PDF and have undertaken, either voluntarily or on foot of a contractual commitment, to complete a period of service in the FLR. The FLR is an area which will be examined in the context of work arising from the Commission on the Defence Forces (CoDF). As an interim measure, the Department are receiving business cases from the Military Authorities for applications for personnel wishing to join the FLR. The applications are assessed on a case by case basis having regard to the particular skills-sets of the member. Since 2020, the Department has received 9 applications in total of which 6 have been approved and a further 1 is currently under consideration.The Military Authorities have advised that as of 31 December 2023, the strength of the First Line Reserve (FLR) is 282, A full breakdown of FLR members, including those enlisted between the years 2013 – 2022, is as follows:   I would like to assure the Deputy that it is my intention, and that of the Chief of Staff, to ensure that the momentum behind the regeneration of the RDF will be maintained, thereby enabling us, going forward, to create a Reserve Defence Force that can seamlessly train, operate and deploy with the Permanent Defence Force, both nationally and internationally.",

   "CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of social housing units.  This loan facility can support between 25% and 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.

  ["The Emergency Humanitarian Flooding scheme is available to businesses with up to 20 employees, (whole-time equivalents), community, voluntary and sporting bodies that through no fault of their own cannot secure flood insurance. For the purpose of this scheme a small business is defined as one with up to 20 employees (whole-time equivalents). The business premises must have been damaged by flooding caused by the severe weather events which occurred during the period 17th October to 13th November 2023. This fact must be verified by the relevant Local Authority.  At the time of the flood, the business must have been trading and in rateable premises (where the premises is not subject to commercial rates, the applicant should supply a tax clearance certificate as supporting documentation, or where this is not available, a recent official document from Revenue showing the tax registration number of the business). Where the fixtures or fittings of the business are outdoors due to the nature of the business, they would be considered eligible for the scheme.  The Scheme closed to applications on 15th December 2023."
   "Since 2009, the Office of Public Works, (OPW) has approved funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme of circa €5.7 million to County Cork for some 45 projects. The Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme was introduced by the OPW in 2009.  Applications for funding from local authorities are considered for flood relief and erosion protection measures costing up to €750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.  Full details of this scheme are available on www.floodinfo.ie. Funding approval under this scheme of €295,027 was allocated to Cork County Council in 2021 for minor embankment and improvement works, construction of a flood defence, a storm water pumping station, new drainage pipes and associated works at the location concerned.  Cork County Council confirmed that they are providing additional funding to allow an enhanced scheme to be developed, building on the elements of the approved OPW funding.  Hydraulic modelling work completed in early February 2024 will inform the scheme and Cork County Council plan to advertise the tender for a Consultant to undertake the detailed design, planning, procurement and management of the delivery of the project in the coming weeks.   Question No. 102 answered orally."
   "The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the maintenance of arterial drainage schemes completed under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995, as amended. The location concerned forms part of the Corrib-Headford Arterial Drainage Scheme. The channel at the location is prioritised as it drains the area surrounding and including Headford Town.  A recent inspection of the channel, shows it to be free flowing. Due to the proximity of Lough Corrib, the channel in question is subject to high water levels in the winter as the lake levels rise.  Maintenance on the channel is planned for this year and my officials in the OPW are monitoring the channel."
   "The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) Flooding Relief Scheme is an emergency humanitarian contribution for businesses, (up to 20 employees), community, voluntary and sporting bodies, who are unable to secure flooding insurance though no fault of their own, to assist them in returning their premises to their pre-flood condition. In relation to non-flooding damage to property which has been caused by storms , property owners should in the first instance get in touch with their insurance companies as businesses that suffer damage or loss of property from severe weather events should ordinarily have insurance against that risk. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) Flooding Relief Scheme is intended as an emergency humanitarian assistance contribution only and not as compensation for loss or a replacement for the cover provided by insurance."
   "I am aware of the devastating flooding caused by Storm Babet late last year to Mogeely. Flooding has a very significant impact on people, families, businesses and communities. Localised flooding is a matter for the Local Authority, who can apply under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, for funding to undertake short-term measures in the form of mitigation works to address fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative area.  Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than €750,000 in each instance. Funding up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects. Once an application is received, the OPW will assess it with regard to the specific economic, technical, social and environmental criteria of the scheme. If approved, it will then be the responsibility of the Local Authority to implement and maintain the interim works.  The OPW have been advised that Cork County Council is currently preparing an application to the scheme for interim flood risk mitigation works at Gleann Fia and at other locations in Mogeely. I understand that Cork County Council are considering all possible solutions, including the proposal suggested in your question, to mitigate against flooding in that area."],
