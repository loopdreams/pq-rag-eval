The exercise consisted of an initial evidence gathering and a subsequent evidence synthesis, the results of which were published in January.

   "Statutory Instrument No. 262/2019 - Misuse Of Drugs (Prescription And Control Of Supply Of Cannabis For Medical Use) Regulations 2019 is the legislative basis for the MCAP. The purpose of these Regulations is to allow certain cannabis products or preparations for medical use to be prescribed and supplied under certain circumstances for the treatment of persons with certain medical conditions under the care of a medical consultant. In the Regulations “medical consultant” means a registered medical practitioner who— (a) is registered on the Specialist Division of the register of medical practitioners established and maintained by the Medical Council under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 (No. 25 of 2007), and (b) by reason of his or her training, skill and experience in a medical specialty recognised by the Medical Council under section 89(1) of that Act related to a specified therapeutic indication, is consulted by other registered medical practitioners and has a continuing clinical and professional responsibility for that aspect of the patient’s care on which he or she has been consulted. The Minister for Health is not responsible for consultant training in any speciality."
   "The legislative basis for the MCAP is Statutory Instrument 262/2019, Misuse Of Drugs (Prescription And Control Of Supply Of Cannabis For Medical Use) Regulations 2019.

There appears to be a significant gap between the public perception of effectiveness and safety, and the regulatory requirement for scientific data which is mandatory to determine the role of cannabis as a medicine.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.\n\nLocal authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters. In December 2020 I announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme under which a total of 35 “Class B” fire appliances were allocated across the fire authorities. It was envisaged that through an extension of that framework an additional allocation of appliances would be proposed for the period 2024-2025.\n\nLocal authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide, with 16 of these stations staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters. My Department continues to support the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) who are leading engagement with staff representatives on the implementation of recommendations contained within the Retained Review published in December 2022 and the WRC Agreement. I continue to closely monitor the engagement of the LGMA and Fire Services Management to ensure that the implementation of the WRC agreement continues to be a top priority for 2024.",

The Government has delivered a university presence to the South East spanning four campus locations for the first time in the history of the State. The South East Technological University (SETU) established on 1 May 2022 is the third largest technological university and enables students in the South East to study and gain qualifications at all levels of the NFQ, up to and including doctoral degrees, in their own region.\n\nSETU is also a catalyst for regional development and socio-economic progress in the South East. The Department also remains committed to providing capital funding supports to SETU. For example, the new Engineering, Computing and General Teaching building which is planned for SETU Waterford Campus is progressing as part of bundle II of the 'Higher Education PPP Programme'. This building will add significant capacity to the campus to help address increased demand.\n\nThe Government through my Department remains fully committed to the delivery of the Engineering, Computing and General Teaching building at the South East Technological University (SETU) campus at Waterford. The project in Waterford is the largest in the Higher Education PPP Programme and will be transformative for SETU. It will consist of undergraduate and postgraduate laboratories, general and specialised teaching space, learning resource space, administration space and ancillary space. Student numbers catered for by the new building will be c.\n\nTechnological Universities are autonomous bodies established under the Technological Universities Act 2018. Technological Universities regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes. The Technological Universities Act provides that the President shall be appointed by the Technological University and that the selection criteria, including experience, training and expertise appropriate to the functions of a president under the Act, and procedures in respect of the appointment of a president shall be established by the technological university.\n\nThe first tertiary programmes commenced in September 2023, and earlier this month I announced a major expansion of joint degree courses with more than 40 options to be offered this year.   It is clear that substantial progress has been made to date and that Technological Universities are contributing substantially to a dynamic and innovative higher education system.",

In 2023 we issued 474 more licences than applications received and my Department intends to continue to outstrip demand by issuing more licences than it receives in 2024. In 2023, my Department issued 3,169 forestry licences of all types.\n\nWe estimate that we will issue 1,000 new afforestation licences in 2024.  To date in 2024 we have received 71 valid afforestation applications with 81 approvals issuing in the same period. Since 2020 there has been a significant turnaround in the number of licences issued by my Department.\n\nOf these, 2,267 have received a final decision on their application.  There are a further 339 applications where a decision has been reached but the Certificate fee and further documentation are awaited, and there are 32 applications at final decision stage. Finally, 1,091 applications remain in progress at various stages in the naturalisation process.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 283 together.My Department has published a Forestry Licencing Plan which outlines our strong commitment to issuing licences in 2024. We estimate  that we will issue 4,200 new licences in 2024, and we believe we now have the capacity to issue sufficient licences to meet the  annual target of 8,000 hectares of new forests.\n\n My Department began issuing  afforestation and roads licences under the new Programme in September 2023, while felling licences continued and continue to issue as normal. We are now issuing all licences, as well as approvals under other forestry schemes. The new Forestry Licensing Plan has now issued and in 2024, my Department will continue to build on the improvements to its licencing system.",

Some of these delays were due to the time required to recruit the Community Climate Action Officers (CCAOs).\n\n My Department has also provided a range of other significant funding options for communities and voluntary organisations to lead on climate action including:• EU Just Transition Fund Programme• Community Climate Action Programme – Creative Climate Action Phase 2 (more details here)\n\nProjects are being implemented across a range of activities, including regional development, green energy, tourism, conservation, regeneration and retrofitting of buildings, education, food research, and business development. The following table sets out an overview of the grant funding provided to these projects.   In relation to Ireland's EU Just Transition Fund Programme, details of grant awards under individual funding calls will be made available as they are announced through the website of the Programme's Managing Authority at  Separately, the Climate Action Plan 2023 committed the Government to the establishment a Just Transition Commission to provide advice to Government on how to ensure a just transition.\n\n While my officials were working towards the end of 2023 for completion, it is important to ensure that the Strategy aligns with the latest climate data and projections and with the detailed pathways to 2030 set out in Climate Action Plan 2024, published 20 December 2023. As such, the Strategy will now be finalised in Q1 2024. The updated Strategy will be the first national long-term climate strategy to be prepared in line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Acts 2015 to 2021.",
