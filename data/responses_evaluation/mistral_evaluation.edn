The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness, and sustainability and to ensure it services students and their families efficiently and effectively.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 626 and 629 together.The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the current school year over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.\n\n The Department has recently completed a review of the School Transport Scheme.
