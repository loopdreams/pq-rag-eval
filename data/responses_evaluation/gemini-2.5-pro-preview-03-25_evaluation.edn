The Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services Director (ONMSD) within its scope of governance designs, develops and delivers continuous professional development and clinical leadership, with programmes of education ranging from level 5 to level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications.\n\nTraining is provided to Health Care Assistants who support the nursing and midwifery function through the ONMSD Centres of Nursing and Midwifery Education with the achievement of Ireland QQI Level 5 Major award in Health Service Skills.

The scheme does not generally support studies at masters level.\n\nProgramme content is updated from time to time to allow for technical or legislative changes. QQI will be involved in the revalidation of all craft programmes in the planned move towards a single integrated apprenticeship system which is one of the five overarching objectives under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.

Rural communities are already starting to see the benefits of these plans, as identified projects have applied for funding through my Department’s funding streams, including the 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, to create vibrant town centres. In July last year, I announced funding of €15 million for this year’s Town and Village Renewal Scheme.\n\nThe mission of the Department of Rural and Community Development is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland. To this end, the Department has a number of funding schemes within which the purchase of land/buildings to be repurposed for community use may be eligible subject to scheme conditions. The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS), introduced in 2016, is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.\n\nCapital schemes including the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, LEADER, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the Local Improvement Scheme, and the Community Centre Investment Fund are delivering projects throughout the country. Current funding supports such as the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and the Community Services Programme are helping to tackle social exclusion and support thriving communities. In addition to our long standing funding supports, over the course of 2022/2023, my Department has introduced a number of new schemes to meet the emerging needs of communities.\n\n  The 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme which was launched last July with funding of €15 million is also designed to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland. The closing date for applications was 10th November 2023, and the assessment process has now commenced. I expect to announce successful projects by the end of Quarter 1 of 2024.\n\nThe mission of the Department of Rural and Community Development is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.
