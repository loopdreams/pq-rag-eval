There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year The School Transport Scheme is an important service for families and children.\n\nThe Government is committed to working to achieve the report’s recommendation of expanding access to the scheme so that an additional 100,000 pupils can be carried by 2030.  Throughout the review, the value of the School Transport Scheme to both families and in supporting wider Government policies has been very apparent.  In summary, school transport  not only plays an important part in supporting children's access to education, but it also aligns to wider Government objectives.\n\nA review of the School Transport Scheme has recently been completed by a Steering Group with high level membership of relevant Government Departments and other bodies, reflecting the importance of the scheme for access to education and other wider Government objectives.
