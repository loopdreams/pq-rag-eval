There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year The School Transport Scheme is an important service for families and children.\n\nThe Government is committed to working to achieve the report’s recommendation of expanding access to the scheme so that an additional 100,000 pupils can be carried by 2030.  Throughout the review, the value of the School Transport Scheme to both families and in supporting wider Government policies has been very apparent.  In summary, school transport  not only plays an important part in supporting children's access to education, but it also aligns to wider Government objectives.\n\nA review of the School Transport Scheme has recently been completed by a Steering Group with high level membership of relevant Government Departments and other bodies, reflecting the importance of the scheme for access to education and other wider Government objectives.

I am advised by Revenue that its drugs interdiction strategy supports the Government’s strategic approach to the misuse of drugs under the National Drugs Strategy 2017-2025.\n\nAs the Deputy is aware, the Government’s approach to the misuse of drugs is set out in Ireland’s National Drug Strategy, ‘Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery’. This is a health-led approach to drug and alcohol use in Ireland, and it represents a whole-of-Government response to reduce demand and associated harms. The Government is also committed to limiting access to illegal drugs to the greatest extent possible.\n\n These large seizures demonstrate the close cooperation between Gardaí and partner services to interrupt the supply of illegal drugs into and throughout the country.The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy \" The implementation of the strategy is led by the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy. However, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda Síochána.  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use.\n\nThe national drug strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, sets out government policy on drug and alcohol use for the period 2017 to 2025. The strategy provides an integrated health-led approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery. The vision of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery is for a healthier and safer Ireland.\n\nThis strategy represents a whole of Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. This Government is acutely aware of the sustained and significant damage that the importation and use of illicit drugs has on communities right across the country and that it funds organised crime. Every effort is made to combat not just the importation of illicit drugs but also firearms, ammunition and cash that inevitably accompany this very serious organised criminal activity.", :token-overlap-p-by-sentence [0.25 0.43478260869565216 0.6 0.5555555555555556 0.0 0.46153846153846156 0.5833333333333334 0.0 0.2727272727272727 0.4444444444444444 0.35294117647058826 0.25 0.3333333333333333 0.3 0.0 0.5454545454545454 0.0 0.5263157894736842 0.0 0.13333333333333333 0.5 0.125], :answer "Okay, let’s delve into the government’s approach as outlined in the context you provided.
