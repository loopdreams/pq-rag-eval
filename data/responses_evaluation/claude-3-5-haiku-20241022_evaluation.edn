It is worth noting that the Government has undertaken measures to increase GP capacity and improved access to services. Increased annual investment of over €211 million was provided for under the 2019 GP Agreement, providing for increased GP fees, supports and new services.\n\nThe Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, and that these challenges limit access to GP services in certain areas and can impact on the timely provision of care. While some issues are specific to certain areas, there is undoubtedly a general increase in demand for GP services due in part to demographics and our aging population. The Government has implemented a range of measures in recent years to increase the number of GPs practicing in the State so that patients across the country have access to GP services.\n\nThe review, with input from key stakeholders, will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice, including issues related to GP capacity, and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future. The provision of GP services in certain rural and urban deprived areas that are underserved, and the possible mechanisms to attract more GPs to these locations, is a specific issue that will be examined under the review.\n\nThe programme will help to quickly improve access to GP services, particularly in areas with limited access.  Lastly, my Department and the HSE have commenced a Strategic Review of General Practice. The review, with input from key stakeholders, is examining the broad range of issues affecting general practice, including issues related to GP capacity, and when completed will set out the measures necessary to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future.\n\nI thank the deputy for their question.
