The Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services Director (ONMSD) within its scope of governance designs, develops and delivers continuous professional development and clinical leadership, with programmes of education ranging from level 5 to level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications.\n\nTraining is provided to Health Care Assistants who support the nursing and midwifery function through the ONMSD Centres of Nursing and Midwifery Education with the achievement of Ireland QQI Level 5 Major award in Health Service Skills. The total credit value required for this certificate is 120. The programme comprises of 8 modules – each module has a credit value of 15 European Credit Transfers’ (ECT’s).\n\n For higher education courses, jobseekers can be supported to take undergraduate courses up to honours degree level (QQI level 8). At the postgraduate level, Back to Education Allowance may be approved to undertake studies leading to a Higher Diploma (Level 8) in any discipline and the Professional Masters in Education (Level 9). The scheme does not generally support studies at masters level.\n\nProgramme content is updated from time to time to allow for technical or legislative changes. QQI will be involved in the revalidation of all craft programmes in the planned move towards a single integrated apprenticeship system which is one of the five overarching objectives under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.
