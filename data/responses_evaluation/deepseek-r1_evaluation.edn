The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02m. There has been an overall increase in both applications and tickets issued for the 2023/2024 school year in comparison to the 2022/2023 school year The School Transport Scheme is an important service for families and children.\n\nThe Government is committed to working to achieve the report’s recommendation of expanding access to the scheme so that an additional 100,000 pupils can be carried by 2030.  Throughout the review, the value of the School Transport Scheme to both families and in supporting wider Government policies has been very apparent.  In summary, school transport  not only plays an important part in supporting children's access to education, but it also aligns to wider Government objectives.\n\nA review of the School Transport Scheme has recently been completed by a Steering Group with high level membership of relevant Government Departments and other bodies, reflecting the importance of the scheme for access to education and other wider Government objectives. Undoubtedly, the School Transport Scheme is of huge importance to families. The review has been conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness, and sustainability and to ensure it services students and their families efficiently and effectively.\n\nI propose to take Questions Nos. 626 and 629 together.The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education.  In the current school year over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services, 19,800 pupils with special educational needs, and 6,800 pupils who have arrived to Ireland from Ukraine are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.\n\n The Department has recently completed a review of the School Transport Scheme.  The review was conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.

Let me scan through them carefully.\n\nThe first paragraph states: \"over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services.\" So that's the total number of pupils transported daily via STS. \n\nNext, it says there are 19,800 pupils with special educational needs being transported as well.\n\nThen, separately, it mentions 6,800 pupils who have arrived from Ukraine.\n\nWait a minute, so does this mean these 6,800 are part of the total 161,600? Because in the first sentence, \"including\" suggests they're included in that larger number. However, there's also a specific mention about pupils with special educational needs and those from Ukraine as separate groups.\n\nBut looking again, it says: \"over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services,\" which includes all pupils, including those with special needs and from Ukraine? Or are they separate?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The first sentence talks about over 161k children, of whom 135k are in primary and post-primary. Then it says \"including\" 19,800 with special educational needs. So perhaps that 19,800 are part of the total 161,600.\n\nThen separately, there's mention of 6,800 pupils from Ukraine. If these are also included in the same group transported via STS, then maybe the breakdown is as follows:\n\nTotal pupils: 161,600\n\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n- Special educational needs: 19,800 (so perhaps this is within primary/post-primary)\n- From Ukraine: 6,800 (also likely within the same group)\n\nWait, but that would mean adding them up: 135k +19.8k +6.8k = over 161.6k, which matches the total.\n\nSo if I add these together:\n\n135,000 primary/post-primary\n\nWithin those, 19,800 have special needs\n\nAnd of all pupils (including those in primary/post-primary), 6,800 are from Ukraine.\n\nBut wait, does that mean there's overlap? Like some pupils with special needs could also be from Ukraine. So it's possible but not certain if they're separate groups or overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 19,800 include those from Ukraine. Or maybe the 6,800 are an additional group beyond the primary/post-primary and special needs.\n\nThis is a bit confusing because the wording doesn't clarify whether these numbers are exclusive or overlapping.\n\nBut looking at the context again:\n\nThe first paragraph: \"over 161,600 children, including over 135,000 pupils travelling on primary and post primary services.\" So total STS users are 161k, of whom 135k are on primary/post-primary.\n\nThen it says \"including\" 19,800 with special needs. So that suggests the 19,800 are part of the 161k.\n\nSimilarly, the next line mentions 6,800 pupils from Ukraine and says \"are transported on a daily basis.\" So these 6,800 are also included in the total STS user count.\n\nSo if that's the case, then:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nPrimary/post-primary only: let's assume primary/post-primary includes all except special needs and from Ukraine. But wait, maybe some pupils with special needs could be on primary/post-primary, so they are already counted in the 135k.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should structure it as:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Within these, pupils with special educational needs: 19,800 (assuming all are within primary/post-primary)\nBut also, there are 6,800 pupils from Ukraine. Are they part of the 135k or separate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total is:\n\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Of these, some have special needs (but the context says \"including\" those with special needs, so that might mean within the STS)\nBut then it also mentions 6,800 from Ukraine.\n\nWait, maybe the breakdown is:\n\nTotal pupils on STS: 161,600\n\n- Primary and post-primary services: 135,000\n   - Of these, 19,800 have special educational needs (so this would be part of the primary/post-primary group)\nBut then separately, there's 6,800 pupils from Ukraine. Are they included in the 135k?\n\nIf so, then total breakdown:\n\n- Primary/post-primary: 135,000\n   - Special needs: 19,800 (already within primary/post-primary)\nBut also, 6,800 from Ukraine are part of the same group.\n\nWait, but that would mean adding them up, which they aren't because 135k +19.8k is already over 154k, plus 6.8k would make 161.8k, which matches the total.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Primary/post-primary: 135,000\n   - Special needs within them: 19,800\nBut also, there are 6,800 pupils from Ukraine, who may be part of primary/post-primary but with special needs or not. Or maybe they're separate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the breakdown is:\n\n- Primary and post-primary only: X\n\n- Special educational needs (regardless of primary/post-primary): 19,800\n\nBut then total would include pupils from Ukraine as well.\n\nThis is getting too confusing without more clarity in the text. Maybe I should infer based on standard practices or structure it in a way that makes sense.\n\nProbably:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Special educational needs: 19,800 (so these are within primary/post-primary)\nBut then the pupils from Ukraine could be part of the remaining.\n\nSo after accounting for special needs in primary/post-primary:\n\nPrimary/post-primary without special needs: 135k -19.8k = 115.2k\n\nThen, total STS users would include those with and without special needs and any others (like from Ukraine).\n\nBut since the text mentions pupils from Ukraine separately, they might be in addition to primary/post-primary.\n\nWait, but primary/post-primary includes all pupils transported via STS who are on primary or post-primary education. So if someone is from Ukraine, unless specified otherwise, they could be in primary/post-primary.\n\nTherefore, perhaps:\n\nPrimary and post-primary: 135k\n\nWithin them:\n   - Special educational needs: 19.8k\n   - Without special needs: 135k -19.8k = 115.2k\n\nFrom Ukraine: 6.8k (assuming they are within primary/post-primary)\n\nSo total would be:\n\nPrimary/post-primary with special needs and without, plus from Ukraine.\n\nBut since the text says \"including\" pupils with special needs in the STS users, it's unclear if the 19.8k are part of the 135k or a separate group.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe the correct breakdown is:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\n- Primary and post-primary only: X\n   - Special needs within them: Y\nBut we don't have X directly. The text says \"including\" primary and post-primary as 135k.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to present the breakdown as:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Pupils with special educational needs: 19,800 (part of primary/post-primary)\nBut then pupils from Ukraine are also part of the total. If they're within primary/post-primary, but perhaps not overlapping with special needs.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPrimary and post-primary:\n   - With special needs: 19,800\n   - Without special needs: 135k -19.8k = 115,200\n\nPupils from Ukraine are part of primary/post-primary but not necessarily with special needs.\n\nSo pupils from Ukraine: 6,800 (within primary/post-primary)\n\nBut if some of those have special needs, it's possible that 19.8k includes them, so the number without would be:\n\nTotal from Ukraine and primary/post-primary:\n   - With special needs: let's say A\n   - Without special needs: 6,800 - A\n\nBut since we don't know how many of the 6,800 have special needs, perhaps they are separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe pupils with special needs can be from anywhere, including Ukraine.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should state that based on the text:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Pupils with special educational needs (within primary/post-primary): 19,800\nBut also, pupils from Ukraine are part of the total STS users. If they're within primary/post-primary but not overlapping with the special needs count, then:\n\nFrom Ukraine and without special needs: 6,800\n\nThus, total breakdown would be:\n\nPrimary and post-primary:\n   - Special needs: 19,800\n   - Without special needs: 135k -19.8k = 115,200\n\nFrom Ukraine without special needs: 6,800 (within primary/post-primary)\n\nBut since pupils from Ukraine could also have special needs, perhaps the 19,800 include those.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that pupils with special needs are a subset of all STS users, and separately, there are 6,800 from Ukraine, which might be another subset overlapping or not overlapping.\n\nBut without more information, I think the best way is to present the total as:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary only: Not directly given\n   - But since it's unclear, perhaps it's better to say that within the primary and post-primary group, there are pupils with special needs (19,800) and without.\n\nBut I think a more logical approach is:\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary education:\n   - With special educational needs: 19,800\n   - Without special educational needs: ?\n\nAdditionally, pupils from Ukraine are part of the total. If they're within primary/post-primary:\n\nPupils from Ukraine with special educational needs: Not given\n\nPupils from Ukraine without special educational needs: Not given\n\nSo perhaps we can't exactly break it down into three categories (primary/post-primary with and without, and from Ukraine) because some data points overlap.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is to provide two breakdowns:\n\n1. Total STS users: 161,600\n   - Primary and post-primary education: 135,000 (including pupils with special needs)\n      - Pupils with special educational needs: 19,800\n\n2. Additionally, pupils from Ukraine: 6,800 (assuming they are part of primary/post-primary but not necessarily overlapping with the special needs count)\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nTotal STS users:\n   - Primary and post-primary education: 135,000\n      - Pupils with special educational needs: 19,800\n   - From other regions (e.g., Ukraine): 6,800\n\nBut then total becomes 135k +19.8k +6.8k = 161,600, which matches the first number.\n\nWait, that adds up: 135k primary/post-primary, plus pupils from Ukraine (6.8k) and special needs within primary/post-primary? No, because 135k already includes all primary/post-primary, regardless of special needs.\n\nSo if pupils with special educational needs are a subset of the 135k, then total would be:\n\nPrimary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Special educational needs: 19,800\n\nTotal STS users: 161,600\n\nSo remaining STS users (161.6k -135k =26.6k) would be pupils from other regions like Ukraine and without special education.\n\nThus:\n\nBreakdown:\n- Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n   - Special educational needs: 19,800\n\n- From other regions (e.g., Ukraine): 26,600 (assuming no overlap with primary/post-primary except for those counted in special needs)\n\nBut wait, the text mentions pupils from Ukraine separately, so perhaps:\n\nTotal STS users:\n   - Primary and post-primary: 135,000\n      - Special educational needs: 19,800\n   - From Ukraine (which could be within primary/post-primary): 6,800\n\nSo total would be 135k +6.8k =141.8k, but the total is given as 161.6k.\n\nThus, the remaining pupils from other regions without special needs:\n\n161.6k -141.8k=19.8k\n\nBut we have already accounted for special educational needs (19.8k). So perhaps those are overlapping.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to present the answer as two separate breakdowns: one focusing on primary/post-primary and their special needs, and another adding pupils from Ukraine.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of students transported by special education in the area can be broken down into two main categories:\n\n1. **Students in Primary and Post-Primary Education**:\n   - Total: 135,000\n     - Among these, 19,800 have special educational needs.\n\n2. **Students from Other Regions (e.g., Ukraine)**:\n   - Total: 6,800\n\nAdding these together gives the overall total of students transported by special education in this area:\n\n- **Total Students Transported**: 135,000 (primary/post-primary) + 6,800 (from other regions) = 141,800.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that some pupils with special needs may also be from other regions like Ukraine. The exact overlap between these categories isn't specified in the provided information.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- **Total Students Transported by Special Education**: 161,600\n  - **Primary and Post-Primary Education**: 135,000 students (including 19,800 with special needs)\n  - **From Other Regions (e.g., Ukraine)**: 26,600 students\n\nThis breakdown accounts for all transportation needs within the area.", :cosine-similarity 0.7718339475648633, :bleu-faithfulness 3.741227555150082E-4, :rouge-l-f1 0.04921700167239715} {:metric-llm-faithfulness-explanation "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The context clearly states existing qualifications (Level 5, up to Level 8, and postgraduate Level 9) and makes no mention of any Level 6 courses, so one can conclude that no Level 6 courses are designated for healthcare assistants.

Let me start by reading the context provided carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that at the end of Q3 2023, there were nearly 57,617 households actively receiving HAP support. It also talks about tenancies set up since the scheme started, with a significant number being active in 2023. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking for the number of households in receipt in 2023, not just at the end of Q3 or the total tenancies. I should check if there's information about the entire year 2023.\n\nLooking through the context again, it mentions that between 2021 and the end of 2023, expenditure on HAP increased by 28%. But that doesn't directly give me the number of households for each year. It also states that at the end of Q3 2023, there were about 57,617 active tenancies, which are the households.\n\nI think I should focus on the part where it says \"At the end of Q3 2023, just under 115,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, with 57,617 active tenancies being supported under the HAP Scheme.\" So that clearly states the number for Q3.\n\nBut wait, is there any data about the total households in receipt of payments for 2023 as a whole? The context doesn't mention annual figures beyond the expenditure percentage. Since the question asks for the number in 2023, and only Q3 is specified with exact numbers, I might have to infer that perhaps the figure provided at the end of Q3 represents part of the 2023 data.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about the entire year's total, it's safer to stick with what's given. So, I'll use the number for Q3 as a representative answer unless there's an annual total specified elsewhere in the context.\n\nWait again, actually looking back, the first paragraph mentions \"At the end of Q3 2023, there were nearly 57,617 households actively in receipt...\" and later talks about tenancies set up since scheme commencement. So it seems that the 57k is the active households at the end of Q3.\n\nIf I'm asked for the total number of households in 2023, but only given Q3 data, I can't provide an exact annual figure without more data. Therefore, based on the available information, the best answer is that there were nearly 57,617 households actively receiving HAP payments at the end of Q3 2023.\n\nI should make sure to clarify in my response that this is the number at the end of Q3 and not the total for the entire year.\n</think>\n\nAt the end of Q3 2023, there were approximately 57,617 households actively in receipt of HAP payments.

Rural communities are already starting to see the benefits of these plans, as identified projects have applied for funding through my Department’s funding streams, including the 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, to create vibrant town centres. In July last year, I announced funding of €15 million for this year’s Town and Village Renewal Scheme.\n\nThe mission of the Department of Rural and Community Development is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland. To this end, the Department has a number of funding schemes within which the purchase of land/buildings to be repurposed for community use may be eligible subject to scheme conditions. The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS), introduced in 2016, is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.\n\nCapital schemes including the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, LEADER, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the Local Improvement Scheme, and the Community Centre Investment Fund are delivering projects throughout the country. Current funding supports such as the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and the Community Services Programme are helping to tackle social exclusion and support thriving communities. In addition to our long standing funding supports, over the course of 2022/2023, my Department has introduced a number of new schemes to meet the emerging needs of communities.\n\n  The 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme which was launched last July with funding of €15 million is also designed to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland. The closing date for applications was 10th November 2023, and the assessment process has now commenced. I expect to announce successful projects by the end of Quarter 1 of 2024.\n\nThe mission of the Department of Rural and Community Development is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.

Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that local authorities work with community groups and retailers through Town Regeneration Officers funded by my Department. These officers have devised plans and worked on applying for funding. Specific projects are using funding streams from my Department, including the 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS), to create vibrant town centres.\n\nIt also notes that since 2016, over €156 million has been allocated through TVRS to more than 1,700 projects. Additionally, there are other funding schemes like LEADER, Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, Local Improvement Scheme, and Community Centre Investment Fund. These support various rural development initiatives.\n\nThe context also talks about the mission of my Department being to promote rural and community development with various funds and schemes aimed at reviving rural areas through capital projects. There are additional new schemes introduced in 2023 to meet community needs, like the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"How is the government encouraging local authorities to apply for the town and village renewal scheme?\" So I need to identify what mechanisms or actions the government has taken to motivate local bodies to participate in TVRS.\n\nFrom the context, it seems that my Department funds these schemes through various funding streams. Local authorities can access funding via these streams once they've applied. The fact that over a hundred projects have been funded since 2016 suggests that past applications were successful, which might encourage current applicants.\n\nThe mention of working with local community groups and retailers indicates collaboration to strengthen communities before applying. The Town Regeneration Officers are facilitating this process through my Department's funding streams, which likely provides structured support and information needed for application.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of new schemes in 2023 aimed at meeting emerging community needs might imply that TVRS is part of a broader strategy to support various aspects of rural development. The emphasis on reinvigourating rural areas could be another motivator for local authorities to apply.\n\nI should also consider if there are any incentives beyond funding, like recognition or support networks, but the context doesn't explicitly mention these. However, the successful application and implementation history might act as a deterrent against not applying.\n\nPutting it all together, the government is encouraging local authorities by providing funding through various streams (including TVRS) after thorough preparation under my Department's initiative with Town Regeneration Officers. The collaborative approach and previous success likely play significant roles in motivating current applications.\n</think>\n\nThe government encourages local authorities to apply for the town and village renewal scheme (TVRS) through a structured and supportive approach:\n\n1. **Funding Mechanisms**: Local authorities can access funding from various streams, including the 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, which offers €15 million. These funds are allocated through my Department's LEADER, Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, Local Improvement Scheme, and Community Centre Investment Fund.\n\n2. **Collaborative Support**: The initiative involves collaboration with local community groups, retailers, and the community teams under the guidance of Town Regeneration Officers funded by my Department. This collaboration aims to strengthen communities before application.\n\n3. **Structured Preparation**: The involvement of my Department's officers facilitates preparation for applications, leveraging past successes from over 1,700 projects funded since 2016, which likely motivates current applicants.\n\n4. **Broader Development Strategy**: TVRS is part of a comprehensive strategy to support rural development and revitalize rural areas, aligning with broader community needs and initiatives.\n\nThis approach provides structured support and recognizes the value of community efforts, encouraging local authorities to engage proactively in the renewal process.", :cosine-similarity 0.6932834526927871, :bleu-faithfulness 2.2941361604319958E-6, :rouge-l-f1 0.13548386948491153}]
