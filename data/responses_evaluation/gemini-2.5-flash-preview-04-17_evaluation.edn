The purpose of the Level 5 Major Health Service Skills Award (HSSA) is to enable the learner to acquire the knowledge, skills and competence to work under supervision in a variety of healthcare settings to enhance their role in service provision to service users or to progress to further and or higher education and training. The Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services Director (ONMSD) within its scope of governance designs, develops and delivers continuous professional development and clinical leadership, with programmes of education ranging from level 5 to level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications.\n\nTraining is provided to Health Care Assistants who support the nursing and midwifery function through the ONMSD Centres of Nursing and Midwifery Education with the achievement of Ireland QQI Level 5 Major award in Health Service Skills. The total credit value required for this certificate is 120. The programme comprises of 8 modules – each module has a credit value of 15 European Credit Transfers’ (ECT’s).\n\n For higher education courses, jobseekers can be supported to take undergraduate courses up to honours degree level (QQI level 8). At the postgraduate level, Back to Education Allowance may be approved to undertake studies leading to a Higher Diploma (Level 8) in any discipline and the Professional Masters in Education (Level 9). The scheme does not generally support studies at masters level.\n\nProgramme content is updated from time to time to allow for technical or legislative changes. QQI will be involved in the revalidation of all craft programmes in the planned move towards a single integrated apprenticeship system which is one of the five overarching objectives under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.  The table below summarises the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes, the date the curricula was first published, and the latest QQI revalidation date.\n\nEnsuring an expanded number of third level places in healthcare programmes is a priority for my Department.

It is worth noting that the Government has undertaken measures to increase GP capacity and improved access to services. Increased annual investment of over €211 million was provided for under the 2019 GP Agreement, providing for increased GP fees, supports and new services.\n\nThe Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, and that these challenges limit access to GP services in certain areas and can impact on the timely provision of care. While some issues are specific to certain areas, there is undoubtedly a general increase in demand for GP services due in part to demographics and our aging population. The Government has implemented a range of measures in recent years to increase the number of GPs practicing in the State so that patients across the country have access to GP services.\n\nThe review, with input from key stakeholders, will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice, including issues related to GP capacity, and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future. The provision of GP services in certain rural and urban deprived areas that are underserved, and the possible mechanisms to attract more GPs to these locations, is a specific issue that will be examined under the review.\n\nThe programme will help to quickly improve access to GP services, particularly in areas with limited access.  Lastly, my Department and the HSE have commenced a Strategic Review of General Practice. The review, with input from key stakeholders, is examining the broad range of issues affecting general practice, including issues related to GP capacity, and when completed will set out the measures necessary to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future.\n\nI thank the deputy for their question.

In addition to our long standing funding supports, over the course of 2022/2023, my Department has introduced a number of new schemes to meet the emerging needs of communities.\n\n  The 2023 Town and Village Renewal Scheme which was launched last July with funding of €15 million is also designed to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland. The closing date for applications was 10th November 2023, and the assessment process has now commenced. I expect to announce successful projects by the end of Quarter 1 of 2024.\n\nThe mission of the Department of Rural and Community Development is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland. Since the launch of the scheme over €156 million has been allocated to more than 1,700 projects across Ireland.", :token-overlap-p-by-sentence [0.7083333333333334 0.8 0.35294117647058826 0.7777777777777778 0.6190476190476191 0.0], :answer "Based on the information available, the text states that local authorities, through the Town Regeneration Officers (funded by my Department), have worked closely with local community groups, retailers, and other members of the Town Teams in devising and delivering on plans.
