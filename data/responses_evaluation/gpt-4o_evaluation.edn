Once a driver is disqualified, their licence is no longer valid.  The offence for driving without a licence is set out in section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.\n\nTo drive a vehicle, a driver with an identified or specified illness must meet strict medical standards, which are assessed by the person’s doctor. Medical checks are required to ensure a person’s fitness to drive for road safety reasons.  A medical report must be completed by a general practitioner (GP) and a licence may be issued for one, three or ten years.\n\nAn Garda Síochána have access to data on the National Vehicle Driver File (NVDF) as part of their Mobility Strategy and therefore can detect and prosecute a driver who continues to drive while disqualified. This is the case whether or not a licence has been surrendered.  It should be noted that for disqualifications issued in 2024, the licence holder is given 14 days in which to surrender the licence/permit from commencement of the disqualification.\n\n While it is an offence not to possess a TV licence, prosecution through the courts is a last resort.
