Following it's completion a paper is to be presented to me outlining the findings of the review and setting out recommended actions to respond to the identified findings.\n\n*   Addressing Underserved Areas: The review will examine the provision of GP services in certain rural and urban deprived areas that are underserved, and the possible mechanisms to attract more GPs to these locations.", :cosine-similarity 0.8137785350246323, :bleu-faithfulness 8.888253660317365E-5, :rouge-l-f1 0.2953020109058151} {:metric-llm-faithfulness-explanation "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The context explicitly states that driving without a licence may result in a fine of up to €5000, imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both, which matches the statement exactly.\",\n  \"score\": \"Yes\"\n}", :rouge-l-recall 0.7777777777777778, :flesch-kincaid-grade-level 12.096, :flesch-reading-ease 52.86800000000002, :rouge-faithfulness 1.0, :retrieved-context ["An individual driving without a driving licence may be fined up to €5000, or be imprisoned for up to 6 months, or both."
